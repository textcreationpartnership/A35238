            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY Of the Kingdom of IRELAND.</head>
            <p>IRELAND hath been always accounted a Land of wonders, and many ſtrange Relations have been made thereof, though the greateſt wonder ſeems to be, that ſuch incredible ſtories ſhould be told, and ſo firmly believed as they are by the Iriſh and divers others, to this very day; To give you a taſte of them, we find it recorded in their Hiſtories that in the North of Munſter there are two Iſlands, a greater and leſs; in the firſt never any Woman or Female Creature entreth but they inſtantly dye, as hath been experimented by Bitches, and She Cats, brought thither to that purpoſe. The Cock Birds, Sing, and hop, upon the Trees, but the Hens, avoid it as a fatal place. The leſſer is called the Living Iſle, becauſe none can dye therein, and therefore thoſe that dwell here when they are even tyred with liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of Sickneſs or Old age, deſire to be conveyed thither, and no ſooner arrive, but they give up the Ghoſt. In the Weſt part of Connaught ſay they, there is an Iſland called Aren to which St. Brendan doth often reſort, the Air whereof is ſo great an enemy to putrefaction, that they never bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Bodies of the dead, but are kept above ground
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57819:4"/>without the leaſt ſmell or offence, ſo that a Son may there view his Father, Grandfather and all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for many Ages paſt.</p>
            <p>In Ulſter is a Lake thirty thouſand paces long, and fifteen thouſand broad, out of which ariſeth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Northern River called Bane wherein there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of great Fiſh, ſo that the Nets are oft bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. It is believed by the Inhabitants that there were very wicked, vicious people formerly living in this place, and there was an Old Prophecy in every ones mouth, that when ever a Well which was therein, and was continually covered and lockt up carefully, ſhould be left open, ſo great a quantity of Water ſhould iſſue thereout as would forthwith overflow the whole adjacent Countrey. It happened that an Old Beldam coming to fetch Water heard her Child cry, upon which running away in haſte ſhe forgot to cover the Spring, and coming back to do it, the Land was ſo over-run that it was paſt her help, and at length She, her Child, and all in that Territory were drowned, which cauſed this Pool that remains to this day. A ſtrange Spring is likewiſe diſcourſed of in Ulſter, wherewith if a man waſh his hair or beard they preſently turn grey, and another of a contrary quality, making all grey hair black. I have ſeen a man, ſaith my Author, who waſhing half his beard with this Water it was all White, the other part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Brown. In Connaught is a Well on the Top of a Hill that Ebbs and Flows equally with the Sea, yet the Water's freſh.</p>
            <p>At Caſtlenock near Dublin is a Window neither glazed nor latticed, yet a Candle being ſet there in the greateſt wind or ſtorm, burns as quietly as in the greateſt calm, and a Spring, the water whereof is wholeſome to humane Bodies, but poiſon to Beaſts. In Kildare is a curious Field upon an Hill where the Iriſh ſay a great Battle will one time or other be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57819:4"/>fought between the Iriſh and Engliſh, with ſuch vaſt effuſion of bloud that a Mill in a Valley hard by, ſhall be turned Four and twenty hours with the ſtreams thereof. In a Plain in this County, they relate thoſe ſtones were formerly placed which are now on Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Plain, and conveyed thither with ſleight of hand by Merlin the Welch Prophet, at the requeſt of Aurelius Ambroſius, King of the Brittains. In the South part of Munſter is an Iſland bleſt by St. Brendane a famous ſhe Saint in this Iſland with this ſtrange quality, That if any Hare, Stag or other wild Beaſt be chaſed thereabout, it makes toward this Iſlet, ſwimming over a ſmall ſtream into it, whither the Dogs dare not purſue, but ſtanding on this ſide the Bank, ſee their Enemy ſit there ſecurely, protected by ſome inviſible Bars from danger. But the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable wonder of all is that of St. Patricks Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory thus deſcribed by the Superſtitious Iriſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In Ulſter there is a Pool which incompaſſeth an Iſland, in one part whereof ſtands a Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inlightened by the glorious appearance of Angels, the reſt of the Iſle is dark and horrid, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a Den for Devils and Evil Spirits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is a Pit which by a door leadeth into a Cave of Stone divided into ſeven parts, which is called St. Patricks Purgatory, for when this Iriſh Saint preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to them, and told them of Joys eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in another life for the Godly, and miſerable Torments to the Wicked, the People came and ſpake thus to him: <q>Sir, Though we like your preaching yet we are not willing to loſe our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you tell us many ſtrange ſtories, perſuading us to forſake our pleaſures and delights on Earth, for which you promiſe us a reward in an unknown place in the other World. You likewiſe threaten us with a diſmal Dungeon appointed for Offenders, which if we could believe to be true would more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57819:5"/>effectually prevail with us to leave our Delights, than any other Motive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. Patrick perceiving that the fear of Torment had more influence upon them than the bleſſedneſs of Heaven, prayed earneſtly that God would give them ſome reſemblance of the future miſery of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souls, whereupon he was directed to this place, wherein if any Perſon would enter, he was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf by prayer and faſting 15 days, during which time the Friers repreſented to him the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the place, and how the evil Spirits would torture them, ſo that as ſoon as they were in, what for want of Food and Sleep, their fancies have been much diſturbed, and they have dreamed of thoſe terrible things that have been told them; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the whole Myſtery of all theſe illuſions, as divers affirmed, who tryed the Experiment in thoſe Superſtitious times; however the Prieſts made good uſe of it, by gaining Credit and Money from the poor deluded People. Neither is that Excellent Bleſſing procured to this Iſland by the Prayers of their Patron St. Patrick to be forgot, namely their Freedom from Serpents; and all other venemous Creatures, to confirm which, one of their Authors confidently Relates the following ſtory. A young Man in the North of England, lying aſleep in the Fields, with his Mouth open, an Adder crept into it, and ſo down into his Belly, and tormented him with ſuch violent pains, that he deſired his Friends to kill him, it never ceaſing to tear and rend his Bowels, but while he was eating; Medicines, nor Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages to Saints would do no good; at length being adviſed to go to Ireland, he no ſooner arrived there, and had eat and drank upon the Iſland, but the Serpent was immediately killed within him, and voiding it downward, was inſtantly cured, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in good health to England. So that it was a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57819:5"/>a Proverb formerly, there was nothing venemous in Ireland, but the Men and Women, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of the Savage and Brutiſh manners of the Wild <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was the inhabiting of this Countrey leſs miraculous, than the place, eſpecially as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity thereof, for it is recorded in the Iriſh Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, that when the Patriarch Noah, threatned the people of the Old World, that vengeance would follow their wickedneſs, and thereupon built an Ark to convince them, that the whole Earth would be overflown in a few years, the generality diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his Admonitions, only Ceſarea Noahs Niece believing her Uncles Prophecy, got a Ship, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with three Men, and fifty Women, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to find out ſome Country, never yet Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but unſpotted with Vice, and thereby free from the Sentence of Gods wrath; After long Sailing, and many Dangers, they at length arrived in Ireland, but within forty days after their Landing the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Deluge came, and ſwept away all theſe new Inhabitants at once; This they ſay, happened in the year after the Creation of the World. 1556. Which was very wonderful, being long before the Art of Navigation was invented.</p>
            <p>But to let this paſs with as little credit, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pleaſes, it will be a ſufficient Honour to the Antiquity of the Iriſh to allow that their Countrey was firſt peopled by ſome of Noahs Kindred, even as ſoon as any Iſland in the World, for their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries relate, that about two hundred years after the Flood, upon the confuſion of Tongues at Babel, Japhet and his Poſterity, imboldned by Noans Ark, built a Ship, wherein they adventured to make new Diſcoveries in the unknown parts of the World; among them was one Baſtolenus, who incouraged by the example of Nimrod, then Monarch of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57819:6"/>reſolved to ſettle a Kingdom in theſe Weſtern Iſlands, where he might Rule without Controul, and at length, Fortune brought him and his People to the Coaſt of Ireland, where he ſetled; and left three Sons behind him. Among his Followers, were ſome of the Poſterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> that were Giants, who by the example of Ninus, Rebelled againſt their King, and ſet up another, who contended together with dubious Succeſs; at length the Giants were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſubdued, their Enemies ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>And here our Iriſh Author tells us, that one of the Giants named Ruanus, who was preſerved, lived above Two Thouſand years after (twice the Age of Methuſalem) by whom St. Patrick was throughly informed of the ſtate of this Country, and being Baptized by him, dyed in the year of our Lord 430. Some few of theſe Giants, hid themſelves in Gaves and Dens after the laſt Battle, till Famine forced them to ſeek for Relief, when creeping out, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Reſiſtance, they grew Bolder, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how matters had happened, ſetled themſelves in the beſt part of the Countrey; Then Magog, one of the Sons of Japhet, Inhabiting in Scythia, in proceſs of time, ſeveral of his Poſterity deſirous to ſeek adventures, landed in Ireland, but were chaſed thence by the Giants, after Wars had continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them 216. Years. Next, the five Sons of Dela from Greece came hither, and utterly routed the Giants, being before weakened by their own Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and then Divided the Country into five pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as they are at this Day, fixing a Stone in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57819:6"/>midſt of the Country, to make the Diviſion more equal, but at length ambition prevailing, one of theſe Sons named Slanius, ſubdued his other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Reigned alone, but was interrupted in his new Dominion, by an Army of Scythians, who invaded the Land, and after them the Brittains, and then the Scots under Gathelus, as is afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, came from Spain, and fixed here, Reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great while in peace, till the Picts came thither out of Scythia under Roderick, being accidentally caſt a ſhore upon thoſe Coaſts, who were brought before the King of Ireland, to whom Roderick thus ſpake.</p>

               <q>It is not becauſe we degenerate from the courage of our Anceſtors, but by the Frowns of Fortune, that we are now become humble Supplicants to Ireland, who never yet ſubmitted to any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Behold Sir King, and regard us well and then believe that it is no ſmall occaſion which makes our luſty Bodies thus to ſtoop. Scythians, we are even Picts of Scythia, from which two Names, there redounds to us much Glory; we will not whine and complain, that Civil Wars at home for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us from our own Country, thereby to move pity in you towards Strangers let our Servants and Children diſcourſe that at Leiſure, we only deſire the Favour to Reſide ſome ſhort time in your Land, as our Neceſſities require. A King craves this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a King, and Souldiers of Souldiers; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are eaſily ſenſible how much it concerns their Honour and Intereſt, to Relieve and Support other Princes oppreſſed by Trayterous practices; yea, all Men are naturally inclined to have Compaſſion of their fellow Creatures, and to be ſenſibly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Calamities. Admit then, we beſeech you, theſe ſcattered Remnants of Scythia. If your Land be narrow, we are not many, if your Soil
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57819:7"/>be Barren, we are born and bred to Hardineſs. If you live in peace, we are at your Command as Subjects. If you make War, we are ready to ſerve you as Souldiers? We demand no Kingdom, no State, no Pomps, nor Triumphs in Ireland, we are here alone, and have left thoſe things behind us, with our Enemies, howſoever you diſpoſe of us, we ſhall be content therewith, not remembring what we formerly have been, but what we now are.</q>

            <p>After mature conſultation with their Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which forbid them to mingle divers Nations in one Realm, as occaſioning quarrels and diſſentions, and conſidering their want of Room, they perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe ſtrangers to go into Brittain, providing Ships and Guides to convey them thither, who lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in the North parts, now called Scotland, where contrary to their expectation, Marius King of the Brittains, waiting their coming, fell upon them, and ſlew King Roderick, and moſt of his Followers, thoſe who eſcaped, upon humble Submiſſion, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to inhabit the uttermoſt parts of Scotland; at length Fergus came out of Ireland with his Scots, and inhabited there, as is already related. The Iriſh, as ſome Authors Write, were firſt converted to Chriſtianity by St James the Apoſtle about this time, though themſelves ſay, that Paladius was firſt ſent from Pope Celeſtine to preach the Goſpel to them, and after him the Renowned St. Patrick, who acted wonders among them, making many female Saints, and among others, St. Bridget, a By blow of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Leinſter, who finding his wench with Child; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57819:7"/>aſſembled near Dublin to hear her Wiſe Counſel in many weighty cauſes. One action in her Childhood made her famous: The King of Leinſter had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her Father for his good Service, a Rich Sword, garniſhed with many coſtly Jewels: This Damſel going often to viſit her poor ſick neighbours, and having not wherewithal to relieve them by reaſon of the covetouſneſs of her Father and Mother, ſhe ſecretly gave them thoſe Jewels out of that uſeleſs Sword, which being known, the King was much offended thereat, and coming one time to Banquet with her Father, he called her before him, not yet above nine years old, demanding how ſhe durſt in that manner deface the gift of a King, ſhe anſwered, <q>They are beſtowed upon a better King than you, whom finding in ſuch extremity I would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all that my Father, yea all that you had, and your ſelves too, if it were in my power, rather than Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſtarve.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of Chriſt 586 the Danes or Norvegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, being much inclined to invade other Countreys, ſenſible they could not find more Barren Londs than their own, grew dreadful both by Sea and Land, ſeizing upon the Iſles of Orkney, and going from thence to Ireland, under one Turgeſius, conquering the Iriſh Kings; and reigned thirty years, exerciſing all kind of Tyranny upon the Nobility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; it happened that the King of Meath was in ſome truſt with him, of whom he required his only Daughter for his Concubine; the Father readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>ſaving your Highneſſes Fancy, there are divers Ladies of Quality in this Countrey, fitter Bed-fellows for a King, than my Brown Girl;</q> and then reckoned up many of his Nieces and Couſens, extolling them to be rather Angels than mortal Creatures, that he even raviſhed the Tyrant with Joy before he ſaw them; but making ſome delay he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57819:8"/>began to ſuſpect that it was only a trick to preſerve his Daughter from him; to take off which the King of Meath ſpake thus to him; <q>If I ſhould ſay that I willingly gave you my only Daughter to be deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, your Highneſs wiſdom would ſurely judge I did but flatter you, and yet if ten ſuch Daughters were dearer to me than the ſatisfying your pleaſure by whoſe bounty and goodneſs ſhe, and I, and all the reſt are ſupported, I ſhould be unworthy of that Friendſhip and Confidence, which you are pleaſed to allow me; as for the Wench, ſhe muſt needs reckon it a great honour to be admitted to to the Bed of ſo great a Prince, ſince Queens have formerly taken long Journeys, to yield themſelves up to Noble Conquerors, in hope to have iſſue by them; if there be any ſcandal in it, a ſhort time will wear that out, but ſuch a friend as you have been to me and mine. I can never hope to find, and therefore fear your diſpleaſure more than the loſs of Twenty Maidenheads, ſince Fathers have not valued to give their own Wives to ſatisfie the Luſts of their Sons; appoint then the time and place, remote from your Court, and I will ſend you my Daughter accompanied with twelve or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ladies, the meaneſt of whom is an Empreſs in compariſon of her, and when they are before you, chuſe your Game as you like, and if my Child chance to pleaſe you, ſhe cannot be too good to be at your Command, I defire only that if any other of your friends ſhall require the ſame favour, your Majeſty would remember whoſe Daughter ſhe is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Tyrant diſmiſſed him with repeated thanks for this liberal offer, and the King of Meath at the time appointed, dreſt up his Daughter in the beſt manner, and with her fixteen handſome beautiful young Men in Womens clothes who were all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

Gonno was now very old and blind, pleaſing himſelf in nothing more than hearing of the Victories of his Sons; when therefore Q.

            <p>We find little material in the Iriſh Chronicles, from this time till the Conqueſt thereof by King Henry the Second, which how it was occaſioned I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57819:9"/>ſhall now relate. In the year 1167. Dermot Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur King of Leinſter poſſeſſed all the Eaſt parts of the Iſle along the Seacoaſts, uſing great cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lords and Gentry; it happened that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice King of Meath going far into the Country, Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot in the mean time ſtole away his Queen by her conſent, which Morrice upon his return reſolving to revenge, repreſented it to Roderick O Conor King of Connaught and Monarch of all Ireland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching his aſſiſtance againſt the vile Adulterer; the People of Leinſter, deteſting both Dermot and his quarrel for his former Tyrannies, univerſally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look him, ſo that he was forced to fly to King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Second for ſuccour, who was then imployed in his Wars in France; Henry had before caſt an eye upon Ireland, becauſe they always aſſiſted the French with men, and Adrian an Engliſhman being now Pope he obtained his conſent for the Conqueſt thereof, upon condition of reducing the Inhabitants to Chriſtianity, who were almoſt turn'd barbarous; at this very time Dermot offered him his ſervice, of which he was very joyful, but having Wars with France, he had not opportunity to go with him, and therefore taking an Oath of Fidelity and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from him, he took him into his Protection, and for his more ſpeedy aſſiſtance ſent him into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land honourably attended, with Letters Patents to this effect, 'Henry King of England, Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy and Aquitain, and Earl of Anjou, to all our Faithful Subjects, Engliſhmen, Normans, <q>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Scots, and to all other Nations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſubject to our Dominion fendeth Greeting.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57819:10"/>as our Leige-man and Faithful Subject, be you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that you have not only our licenſe, but ſhall receive our favour and thanks for the ſame;</q> with theſe Letters he arrived at Briſtow, where he agreed with Richard Strongbow Earl of Pembroke to give him his only Daughter in Marriage, for which the Earl was the next Spring to ſettle him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was to deſcend to him in right of his Wife after Dermots deceaſe, in the mean time Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz Stephens and Maurice Fitz-Gerald his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gentlemen of Wales, promiſed Dermot that if he would aſſure them an Eſtate in the Town of Wexford for ever, they would aſſiſt him to begin the recovery of his Country, while the Earl of Pembroke was providing ſtronger Forces, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Dermot going over privately before, they with Thirty Knights, Sixty Eſquires, and Three Hundred Archers landed in Ireland, being the firſt Engliſhmen that ever came thither, and marching toward Wexford, Dormet met with them with five Hundred Men, and joining their Forces they ſoon took the Town of Wexford, which was freely giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Fitz Stephens, according to their Covenant, and their Army daily increaſing they prevailed ſo much that Roderick the Monarch aſſembled all the Petty Kings to defend their Country; at length an Agreement was made, whereby Dermot was reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his former Eſtate; and more Forces arriving from England, Dermot incouraged thereby reſolved to be revenged of thoſe of Dublin who had been great Enemies to him and his Father, and marching thither they ſoon ſubmitted themſelves to him.</p>
            <p>Now arrived the Earl of Pembroke with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable aid, wherewith he made ſuch notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts that King Henry growing jealous of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſent an Edict to recal all the Engliſh out of Ireland, but the troubles raiſed by Thomas Becket
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57819:10"/>Arch-biſhop of Canterbury hindred the Proſecution thereof; Pembroke was then in Dublin, where he was cloſely beſieged by the Iriſh under Roderick (Dermot dying ſome time before) and was at laſt reduced to ſuch extremity that they reſolved to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forth and dye like men, rather than ſtarve, and ſo iſſuing out with not above two or three hundred men, they valiantly aſſaulted their Enemies Camp, conſiſting of near Thirty Thouſand, with ſo much reſolution, that with great ſlaughter of them they obtained a Glorious Victory, chaſing their Enemies till night came on, and then returning Triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with abundance of Proviſions and Rich Spoil into the City, Roderick himſelf hardly eſcaping with his Life, after which the Earl of Pembroke coming into England ſurrendered Dublin and all the Caſtles and Forts on the Sea coaſts to King Henry, and thereby removed his Jealouſie, and was again received into favour.</p>
            <p>In 1172 King Henry the Second landed with a conſiderable Army, whom Roderick in behalf of himſelf, and all the other petty Princes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom acknowledged for his Soveraign Lord, and the ſupream Prince of all that Iſland, ſo that none refuſed obedience to Henry, but only the Province of Ulſter; the Chriſtmas after, the King Royally feaſted all thoſe Princes, who were become his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at Dublin, and then taught the Iriſh firſt to eat Cranes fleſh, which was before abhorred by them. He then called a Synod where divers abuſes were reformed, and new Canons made for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Government of the Church, and among others, <q>That ſince it had pleaſed God to bring them under the Engliſh Dominion, they ſhould for the future obſerve all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Church.</q> Soon after King Henry returned to England, being ſummoned by the Pope to anſwer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57819:11"/>for the death of Thomas Becket, which occaſioned much Trouble. In 1185. Henry made over all his Right and Title to Ireland, to his youngeſt Son John, after King of England, who Landing at Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford, accompanyed with a few Diſſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whoſe advice he only regarded, cauſed great Commotions, whereupon he went back again the ſame year. After the Death of his Brother Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the firſt, John ſucceeded, and came again into Ireland, ſetling the Country, and Baniſhing the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for ſome Miſdemeanors, but upon ſubmiſſion, gave them pardon, though not without paying him great Fines.</p>
            <p>In 1300. Edward the firſt ſent for Aid out of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to Aſſiſt him in his Wars againſt Scotland, and after his Death, the Scots invaded Ireland, being Aſſiſted by the Wild Iriſh, whereby the Country was miſerably ruined, four Princes of Connaught joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them; but by the valour of the Engliſh, eleven Thouſand were ſlain in one Fight, among whom were the King of Connaught, Okelley a great Lord, and divers others. The Death of Okelly is ſomewhat Remarkable; The Lord Brem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham Commander of the Engliſh Army, ſent one John Huſſey his Eſquire into the Field, to view the dead Bodies, and ſearch whether his old mortal Enemy Okelley, were ſlain among the reſt; Huſſey goes only with one man to turn up the Bodies, and was preſently eſpied by Okelley, that lay lurking behind a buſh, who knowing Huſſey to be a ſtout man, came towards him, and ſaid. <q>Huſſey, thou ſeeſt I am Armed at all points, as well as my Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, thou art naked with thy Page only, ſo that had I not a great kindneſs for thee, for thine own ſake, I would ſlay thee for the ſake of thy Maſter, but if thou wilt come and ſerve me, as I deſire, I promiſe upon St. Patricks Staff, to make thee a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57819:11"/>Lord of a greater Eſtate in Connanght, than thy Maſter hath in Ireland.</q> Theſe words not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Huſſey, a luſty fellow belonging to Okelly, began to reproach him for refuſing ſo fair an offer; ſo that Huſſey had now three to deal with, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſpatcht this fellow firſt, and then ſtruck Okel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys Eſquire, ſuch a blow under the Ear, that he laid him for dead, Laſtly, he fell upon Okelley himſelf, and inſtantly ſlew him; and then perceiving the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, who was only aſtoniſhed with the ſtroke, to revive again, he cauſed him to carry his Lords Head upon a Truncheon, and preſented it to Bremingham who for this notable Service, Knighted Huſſey, and gave him large poſſeſſions, the Succeſſors of whoſe Family, were after Lords of Galtrim.</p>
            <p>In King Edward the Seconds Reign, the Lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Mortimer was ſent over Juſtice into Ireland, at which time Edward Bruce, Brother to Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, who had taken ſeveral places, and cauſed himſelf to be Crowned King of Ireland, was ſlain in a great Battle, wherein the Scots were vanquiſhed; one Mawpas an Engliſhman, who ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the midſt of the fight to encounter Bruce hand to hand, was in the ſearch found dead fallen upon the Body of Bruce. This year 1320. An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity was erected in Dublin, about which time the Lady Alice Kettell with her two Companions, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronelle and Baſell were charged with Inchantment, and that they had conference every Night with a Spirit called Robin Artiſſon, to whom they Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Highway 9 red Cocks, and 11 Peacocks eyes, and that this Lady ſwept the Streets of Kilken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Twilight, bringing all the filth to the Door of her Son William Outlaw, muttering theſe words;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>'To the Houſe of William my Son,</l>
               <l>'Go all the Wealth of Kilkenny Town.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57819:12"/>
The Lady made her eſcape, but in ſearching her Cloſet (ſaith my Author) they found a Wafer of Sacramental Bread, having the Devils Name ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereon inſtead of Jeſus Chriſt, and an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith ſhe greazed a ſtaff, upon which ſhe galloped through thick and thin, as ſhe pleaſed; Petronelle was burnt at Kilkenny, upon this account. In the Reign of King Edward the Third, 1329. The Iriſh in Meath and Leinſter, Rebelled and Vanquiſht the Earl of Ormond, burning fourſcore Engliſh in a Church, and committing woful outrages, at length the Citizens of Wexford falling upon them, ſlew 400, the reſt being drowned in the Water of Slane. At this time Sir Robert Savage a wealthy Knight dwelt in Ulſter, who to ſecure himſelf from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the Iriſh, began to fortifie his Mannor Houſes with Caſtles and Ditches, exhorting his Son and Heir to do the ſame, for the benefit of himſelf and Poſterity; Father, ſays young Savage, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <q>the Proverb, better a Caſtle of Bones, than of Stones, where I have the ſtrength and courage of Men, by the Grace of God, I will never incumber my ſelf with dead Walls, my Fort ſhall be the youthful Blood of my Friends, and where I have room to fight.</q> The Father in a fume left build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the neglect of this Counſel, was the Ruin of that and many other Engliſh Families in Ulſter. This Savage having raiſed Forces againſt the Iriſh, gave to every man before the fight a ſtout Cup of Aquavitae, Wine or ſtrong Ale, and provided Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Beef, Veniſon and Fowls, for their return which his Captains diſliking, conſidering the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of War, ſince the Enemy might happen to feaſt upon the ſame, they being ſo few againſt a multitude of Iriſh, he ſmiling, <q>Gentlemen, ſaid he, You are too full of Envy, this World is but an Inn, wherein we have no certain Intereſt, but are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57819:12"/>only Tenants at the will of the Lord. If it pleaſe him to command us hence, as from our Lodging, and ſet other good fellows in our Room, what hurt can it be for us to leave them meat for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? Let them ſtoutly win it, and eat it. If they ſhould come to our Houſes, we could not but wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com them with what the Countrey affords, and therefore much good may it do them with all my Heart; however, I have ſuch confidence in your Courage and Gallantry, that I doubt not but we ſhall return home ſafe at Night, and Banquet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon our own Proviſions.</q> Which happened accordingly, for falling upon them, they in a ſhort time cut off three thouſand Iriſh-men, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed triumphantly home.</p>
            <p>In 1394. King Richard the Second being much grieved for the Death of his beloved Queen Ann, not able to endure his Chambers of State without Tears, paſſed over into Ireland, to divert himſelf, where divers Princes renewed their Homage to him. In 1398. the Iriſh Rebelling, Roger Mortimer Earl of March, the Kings Lieutenant was ſlain, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Perſons of Quality, to Revenge which, King Richard again ſailed to Ireland, and had ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Skirmiſhes againſt them, killing at one time, two hundred of the Rebels, and many more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then going to Dublin, he continued there ſome time, divers Lords and Princes ſubmitting themſelves, and were received very courteouſly by him. During his ſtay here, he had intelligence, that Henry Duke of Lancaſter his Uncle, whom he had lately Baniſhed, was returned into England, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive him of his Crown, whereupon he committed the Dukes Son, and the Duke of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters Son, both then in Ireland, Priſoners to the Caſtle of Trim, and then imbarquing arrived in Wales, where he found ſuch weak aſſiſtance, that at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57819:13"/>length he fell into his Adverſaries Hands, and was Depoſed by Authority of Parliament, the Duke of Lancaſter being admitted to Reign in his ſtead, by the Name of Henry the Fourth. In whoſe Second year, Sir Stephen Scroop was made Lieutenant, who was much exclaimed againſt by the People, for his former Violences and Extortions under King Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, upon which, his Lady aſſured him, ſhe would no longer continue with him there, unleſs he took a Solemn Oath upon a Bible, not knowingly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to wrong any Chriſtian Creature in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>In the Reign of King Henry 5. 1420. James But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Earl of Ormond being Lieutenant, ſome of the Iriſh Lords making Inſurrections, the Earl fought with them in the red Moor of Athy, where (ſaith my Author) the Sun being almoſt down, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſtood ſtill for three hours, till the Iriſh who were commanded by Omore, and his Terrible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were utterly vanquiſhed, with the loſs of a very few Engliſh, neither did the bog or quagmire inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage either Horſe or Man of Ormonds party, till the feat was accompliſhed, but continued firm, like other ground. In King Henry the Sixths Reign, Richard Duke of York, Father to Edward the fourth, was Lieutenant, his ſecond Son George, after Duke of Clarence, being born in the Caſtle of Dublin. The Earl of Deſmond was Deputy in Edward the fourths time, who ſpeaking Diſgracefully of the Kings marrying the Lady Elizabeth Gray, ſhe carried his Government in Ireland to be examined, and for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57819:13"/>miſdemeanours therein, he was Condemned and Beheaded at Tredagh.</p>
            <p>Girald Earl of Kildare, was Deputy in Henry the Sevenths time, to whom Richard Symonds a ſubtle Prieſt applyed himſelf, bringing to him a young lad his Scholar, named Lambert, whom he affirmed to be the Son of George Earl of Clarence, lately eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of the Tower of London; the Youth had been ſo well Tutored, and acted the part of a Prince ſo Gracefully, that the Earl of Kildare and many others of the Nobility eſpouſed his quarrel, and Crowned him King in Dablin, with much Joy and Triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then raiſing Forces, they Imbarqued for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Landed in Lancaſhire, but were Defeated by King Henry's Army, and Lambert taken, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for Life. In 1460. The Dutcheſs of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, raiſed another Spirit or Illuſion, one Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, whom ſhe ſent into Ireland, aſſuring the Lords, that he was the youngeſt Son of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Fourth, named Richard; who had been ſtrangely preſerved from the Cruelty of his Uncle Crook-back; but he being taken Priſoner, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole Impoſture.</p>
            <p>In King Henry the 8ths time, the Earl of Kildare was continued Deputy; a plain open-hearted man, very paſſionate, and ſoon appeaſed. Being once in a great Rage with his Servants, one of his Eſquires offered Mr. Boyce, a Gentleman retainer an Iriſh Hobby, upon Condition he would juſt then pluck an hair from the Earls Beard: Mr. Boice took him at his word, and knowing the Earls good Nature, ſtept to him, and acquainted him with the buſineſs. <q>Well, ſaid the Earl, I am content but if thou pluck above one Hair, I ſhall reach thee a ſound Box on the Ear.</q> Being accuſed before Henry the Seventh for burning the Cathedral of Caſhels, and many Witneſſes appearing to juſtifie it, he ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57819:14"/>the Fact, to the Wonder and Deteſtation of thoſe preſent; who admiring how he would come off, <q>By Jeſus (ſays he) I would never have done it, had I not been told, that the Arch-biſhop was within it.</q> Now he being there preſent and principal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, the King Laughed at the plainneſs of the man, that he ſhould alledge that for an Excuſe, which was the greateſt Aggravation of his offence; Laſtly, they ſum'd up all in this Article, Finally, all Ireland cannot rule this Earl, No, quoth the King? <q>then in good Faith he ſhall Rule all Ireland;</q> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſtituted him Deputy.</p>
            <p>In 1521. Thomas Howard Earl of Surrey, after Duke of Norfolk was made Lord Lieutenant, and the Earl of Kildare was by the Contrivance of his Enemies, ſummoned over into England, to anſwer ſeveral Accuſations againſt him, and being brought before the Council, the proud Cardinal Wolſey, then Lord Chancellor, charged him with ſeveral Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, as holding Correſpondence with the Iriſh Rebels, eſpecially the Earl of Deſmond, his Kinſman, who had been Treating with the French and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, about invading the Iſland, and not ſeizing him when in his power, with divers other Crimes, uſing theſe Expreſſions to Kildare among others, <q>Surely this jugling and falſe play, becomes neither a man of Honeſty nor Honour; had you but loſt a Horſe or a Cow, two hundred of your Retainers had come at your whiſtle to reſcue the Prey, even from the uttermoſt parts of Ulſter; all the Iriſh in the Country, muſt have fled before you; but in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great an Enemy as Deſmond, merciful God! How nice, how fearful, how backward have you been? One while he is from home, another time he keeps cloſe home, ſometimes he is fled, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Borders, where you dare not venture; I find my Lord, there are dreadful Bugbears on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57819:14"/>the Borders, which affright the Earl of Kidare, Earl, nay King of Kildare, for when you pleaſe, you can command like an Emperour, where you are malicious, the moſt Loyal Subjects are accoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted Iriſh Enemies, and where you plead an Iriſh Rebel, ſhall paſs for a dutiful Subject, Hearts and Hands, Lives and Fortunes, lye all at your pleaſure and thoſe that do not fawn upon you, and flatter you, dare not preſume to come into your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl, as well as the Lords of the Council, were much offended at this odious and abuſive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which was uſual with the Cardinal, deſiring him to name and prove particulars; at length Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare being out of patience, interrupted him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <q>I find my Lord, that you are very fit to be the mouth of this Board, but my Lord, thoſe that put theſe words into your Graces Mouth, had very wide ones themſelves, and have long gaped for my Ruine, and having no other ſtuff, have filled their Mouths with Smoak; what my Couſen Deſmond hath Contrived, I know not, I beſhrew his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Heart, for holding out ſo long, but what is this to me, cannot he Conſpire, but I muſt be of his Council? Cannot he hide, except I wink? Can he have no Friends, but I muſt bethe Traytor? This is ſtrange reaſoning, you would not ſee him, ſay they, when was he within my View? Who ſtood by, when I let him eſcape? they will ſwear it, they ſay, why? Becauſe they have my Letters, they may lye lewdly againſt my Couſen Deſmond, ſince none dares contradict them but for my part, I never thought them to have ſo much Wit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, that I would have ventured the Life of a good Hound, upon their Secrecy or Silence, much leſs my own. Touching my Kingdom, I know not what your Lordſhip means. If your Grace ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57819:15"/>that a Kingdom conſiſts in ſerving God, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Prince, Ruling with Love, ſuppreſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and executing Juſtice, I would be glad to be inveſted with ſo Royal a name, but if you Term me King, as Repining at the Government of my Soveraign, Conniving at Malefactors, or injuring the peaceable, I utterly Diſclaim that odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title, admiring that your Grace, out of your profound Wiſdom, ſeems to appropriate ſo Sacred a Name, to ſuch wicked Actions. But however, I wiſh my Lord, you and I were to change King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but for one Month, I doubt not, but in that time, I ſhould gather up more Crums, than the Revenues of my Earldom are worth. But you you are well and warm, and continue you ſo ſtill, but do not upbraid me with ſuch baſe Crimes, I ſlumber in a hard Cabin, while you ſleep in a Bed of Down, I ſerve the King under the Cope of Heaven, when you are ſerved at home under a Canopy; I drink Water out of my Iron Head-Piece, when you drink Wine out of Golden Cups; my Horſe is Trained up for the Wars, while your Gennet is taught to Amble; You are Be-Graced, and Be-Lorded, you are crept and kneeled unto, when in the mean time, I can find ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard with the Iriſh Borderers, who are ſo ſtout, they will never kneel to me, except I cut off their Legs by the Knees.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Council were much pleaſed at theſe ſharp girds of Kildare againſt Wolſey, who riſing up in a Fury, committed the Earl to Priſon, but he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bailed by the Duke of Norfolk, to the Cardinals great Grief, and entertained in his Houſe; during which, the Iriſh made another Inſurrection, and the Cardinal again charging Kildare, as the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter thereof, committed him to the Tower, for which he was much pityed by the Lieutenant and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57819:15"/>all the Court, who loved him heartily. One Night when the Lieutenant and he were playing at Shovel-Board, a Warrant was ſent for executing Kildare, at which the Lieutenant fetching a deep ſigh, By St. Bride, ſays he, <q>Lieutenant, there is ſome mad game in that Scroll of Paper, but let it fall how it will, have at the Game.</q> When he underſtood the Meſſage, well ſaid he, pray do me the Favour to go <q>to the King, and know certainly, whether it be his pleaſure;</q> The Lieutenant was much afraid of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing the Cardinal, yet kindneſs to his Friend prevailing, he poſted to the King at Midnight, and having Admittance, ſhewed him the Warrant; the King incenſed, as he ſaid, at the Sawcineſs of the Prieſt, gave him his Signet in Token of a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which when the Cardinal underſtood, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and raged in ſuch furious Language, that the Lieutenant went away, leaving him to mutter the Devils Pater-noſter by himſelf. Shortly after Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey was thrown out of Favour, and the Earl reſtored to his Life and Eſtate, and Sir William Sheffington being made Deputy of Ireland, carryed Kildare along with him.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Lieutenant being at Dinner, News came, that the O Moors were in Arms, and ready to invade the Engliſh Pale; whereupon the Mayor of Dublin raiſing Forces, Marched againſt them, who Diſperſing themſelves, a party fell upon the Carriages which were weakly Guarded, but were ſo warmly received, by a ſtout young Man named Patrick Fitz-Simmons, that he routed them, and cut off two of the Rebels Heads. Next Morning the Governors Men who fled from Fitz-Simmons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he run away, and the Carriages were loſt; whereupon the Governor coming in a Rage to the Mayors Tent, cryed out, that his Man Fitz-Symmons was a Cowardly Traytor, in running
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57819:16"/>away, and loſing the Carriages; Fitz-Symmons skipping out of the Tent in his Shirt, with the two Heads in his Hand: <q>My Lord, ſaid he, I am no Coward, I ſtood to my Tackling, and when your Men gave me the ſlip, I reſcued the Carriages, of which theſe Heads are a Token,</q> throwing them down before him; ſayeſt thou ſo, cryed the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, then I cry thee Mercy, and I would I had been with thee, and ſo praiſing and rewarding him, he Diſmiſt him; and ſoon after the O Moors reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Bogs and Faſtneſſes.</p>
            <p>In 1532. The Earl of Kildare having ſeveral great Enemies in Ireland, was again ſent for over into England, and charged with furniſhing his own Forts with Artillery out of the Caſtle of Dublin, for which he was committed to Priſon; he left his Son and Heir, Thomas Fitz-Gerald Vice-Deputy in his ſtead; who hearing his Father was in Cuſtody, the Enemies of the Geraldines incited him to a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thereby to deſtroy the Family of the Geralds. So that Lord Thomas calling a Council, his Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Servants ruſhed into the Chamber com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Armed, for he had been informed, that his Father was to be put to Death, and himſelf to be ſeized, and therefore reſolved to defend himſelf; turning then to the Chancellor, he ſaid: <q>How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly ſoever we have been uſed, and are thus forced to defend our ſelves by Arms, ſince our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Loyalty is miſrepreſented to our Prince, yet let none ſay hereafter, but we acted like Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Soldiers, in uſing this open Hoſtility, and not Treacherouſly and Baſely; this Sword of State is yours, and not mine, I receiv'd it with an Oath, and have uſed it to your Benefit, and ſhould therefore ſtain my Honour, if I ſhould turn it to your Damage or Hurt; I have now need of my own Sword, for the other only flattereth me with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57819:16"/>a painted Scabbard, but hath indeed a Peſtilent Edg, already bathed in the Blood of the Geral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, and now newly whetted for further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, defend your ſelves therefore from us, as from declared Enemies; I am none of King Henry's Deputy, I am his Mortal Foe, I have more mind to Conquer, than to Govern, to meet him in the Field, than to ſerve him as an Officer, if all the Hearts in England and Ireland, who have cauſe fol to do, would joyn in this quarrel, as I hope they will, they would ſoon make him repent his Tyranny and Cruelty, for which the Ages to come may juſtly Regiſter him amongſt the moſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tyrants, of Abominable and Hateful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor taking Lord Thomas by the hand, requeſted him for the love of God, to hear a few words, and then made a moſt Paſſionate Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accompanied with many Tears, to diſſwade him from this raſh Enterprize, but all in vain, for Lord Thomas thus proceeded; <q>It is very eaſie for the ſound, to give Counſel to the Sick, if the Caſe were yours, you would be as impatient, it may be as I; as you require me to Honour my Prince, ſo Duty binds me to Reverence my Parents; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that Tyrannically deſigns to kill my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Father, and threatens my Deſtruction, I will never acknowledge to be my King; if, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, I happen to miſcarry, I had rather dye va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, and at Liberty, than live under Henry in Slavery and Bondage:</q> With theſe words delivering up the Sword, he flung away like a Madman, and aſſembling all the Iriſh he could get together, they committed ſeveral Outrages and Miſchiefs, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon Alen Arch-Biſhop of Dublin, his Old Enemy, his followers murdered him. At length after many Skirmiſhes, he was by the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57819:17"/>Gray perſwaded to ſubmit himſelf to the King; and going to England, was committed to the Tower, Orders being ſent to Ireland for apprehending his five Uncles, who were all Seized, namely, James, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Oliver, John, and Richard Fitz Gerald, though two of them always oppoſed their Nephews Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but King Henry being incenſed againſt them, becauſe he was informed, that as long as any Geraldine breathed in the Countrey, he could never Conquer it. reſolved to be rid of them all. Thus were the Five Brethren Sailing to England, ſome comforting themſelves with the Kings Mercy, and others with their own Innocency, when Richard Fitz-Gerald, who was more Bookiſh than the reſt, chanced to ask the Maſter, what the Name of his Ship was, who anſwering, it was called the Cow, <q>nay then good Brethren, quoth he, I utterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of our return to Ireland, for I remember I have heard an Old Prophecy, that Five Brethren to an Earl, ſhould be carryed into England in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Cow, and never come back again:</q> At which words, the reſt began to howl and Lament in a grievous manner, which ſeemed very ſtrange to the Spectators, that Five ſuch Valiant Gentlemen ſhould be ſo diſturbed at an Old Prophecy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what he foretold, proved true for they no ſooner arrived, but Thomas Fitz-Gerald was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted at Tower-Hill, and the Five Brethren Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Quartered at Tyburn, the Old Earl of Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare died for grief in the Tower, and Gerald the Younger Brother of Thomas flying out of Ireland, Travelled many Forreign Countries, and at length Died at Naples; Soon after the Lord Deputy Gray was Beheaded on Tower-Hill, being accuſed for holding Correſpondence with the Fitz-Geralds, though many thought him Innocent thereof. In the Three and Thirtieth of King Henry the Eight,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57819:17"/>the Title of King of Ireland was by a Parliament ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon him and his Succeſſors for ever, whereas before they were only called Lords of Ireland.</p>
            <p>During the ſhort Reigns of King Edward the Sixth and Queen Mary, our Chronicles relate little of any Tranſactions in Ireland; In 1566. The Seventh of Queen Elizabeth, for the great Fame of her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Donald Mac Carti More, a great Potentate of Ireland, came and delivered up into her hands, all his ample Territories, which ſhe reſtored to him again, and in requital created him Earl of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, giving him many Preſents and paying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his Voyage. In 1570 O Brian Earl of Thomond, not brooking the ſevere Government of Edward Fitton, Preſident of Connaught, entered into a Conſpiracy, which being ready to break forth was ſtrangely diſcovered. For the day before they meant to take up Arms, Fitton knowing nothing of it, ſent word to the Earl in a friendly manner, that the next day he and ſome of his Friends would come and dine with him; the Earl having a guilty Conſcience, thought his deſigns were revealed, and that Fitton would rather come as an Enemy than a Gueſt; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he preſently fled to France, where he confeſſed the whole to Queen Elizabeths Ambaſſador, by whoſe Interceſſion he was afterwards pardoned and reſtored. Four years after Sir Henry Sydney Lord Deputy going into Ulſter, ſeveral Iriſh Grandees ſubmitted themſelves and were received into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>In 1583 the famous Rebel Gerald Fitz-Gerald, the eleventh Earl of Deſmond of this Family, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long time eſcaped the Engliſh in his lurking places, was now diſcovered by a Common Souldier in a poor Cottage and there ſlain, his Head was ſent into England and ſet upon London-bridge. This end had this great Lord, who poſſeſſed whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57819:18"/>and had at leaſt five hundred Gentlemen of his own Name and Race, all whom and his own Life alſo, he loſt within three years, very few of his Family being left alive. And this diſaſter he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by being Trayterous to his Prince, at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of certain Popiſh Prieſts, of whom the chief was one Nicholas Sanders an Engliſhman, who at the ſame time died miſerably of Famine; for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mad upon his ill ſucceſs, he wandred up and down the Mountains, finding nothing to ſuſtain him. In 1558, the Bourks raiſed a Rebellion, the Iriſh declaring they would have one of that Family rule over them, or ſome other Lord out of Spain; neither could they be quieted till the Preſident of Connaughts Brother following them into the Woods, drove away five thouſand head of their Cattel, ſo that after forty days, half ſtarved they came forth and ſubmitted themſelves. But the Preſident underſtanding that about this time two thouſand Scotch Iſlanders were landed and joined with the Iriſh, and ready to break into Connaught, he muſters up his Men to give them Battel; but they flying to Bogs and Woods, he retires back, as though in fear; thereby to draw them to the firm ground; and then ſet upon them with his whoſe force, ſlaying three thouſand which was all their number except fourſcore; by which notable Victory the inſolent attempts of the Scotch Iſlanders, were wholly cruſhed.</p>
            <p>In 1590. Hugh Cavelock, ſo called becauſe he had been ſo long kept in Fetters, the Son of Chan O Neal, accuſed Hugh Earl of Tyrone for holding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Spaniards in 88. who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the accuſation took a Cord, and with his own hands ſtrangled Hugh; For which being ſent for over, he was pardoned upon Condition of future obedience, and reducing the Countrey to Civility.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57819:18"/>After this Mac-Mahon, a potentate of Ireland, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thoſe under him to pay tribute, whereupon the Deputy cauſed him to be taken and tried by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Common Souldiers, and then to be hanged up, dividing his lands between ſome of the Mahons and the Engliſh. Then Brian O Roch fearing he ſhould be ſerved in the ſame manner raiſed a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and being defeated fled into Scotland, but at the Queens requeſt was delivered up, and was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at Weſtminſter, for dragging the Queens Picture at an Horſe-tail, and for giving the Spaniards entertainment; which being told him by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, for he could ſpeak no Engliſh, he ſaid, <q>he would not be tryed unleſs the Queen her ſelf were Judge,</q> but being informed this was the Law, he only ſaid; 'If it muſt be ſo, it muſt be ſo, and was condemned and executed at Tyburn, which he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as little as if all had been in Jeſt. In 1596 Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone with conſiderable forces raiſed a Rebellion and was proclaimed Traytor, after which he gave the Engliſh a great defeat, whereupon all Ulſter, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Connaught were in Arms againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; at length the Earl of Eſſex was ſent againſt him, who inſtead of fighting made a Truce with him. But afterwards, the Engliſh ſo prevailed that Tyrone finding his condition deſperate reſolved to throw himſelf upon the Queens mercy without Conditions; hereupon being admitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Deputy, at the very entry of the Room he fell on his Knees, begging pardon for his great fault againſt God, and a moſt bountiful Prince; the next day the Deputy took him along with him to Dublin, intending to ſend him to England, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could come thither the Queen died.</p>
            <p>In King James his Reign Tyrone and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents abſolutely ſubmitted to his Majeſties pleaſure; who by an Act of Oblivion, publiſhed by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57819:19"/>under the Great Seal, did forgive and utterly extinguiſh all offences againſt the Crown, and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treſpaſſes between Subject and Subject, to all who would come into the Juſtice of Aſſize by ſuch a day, and claim the benefit thereof, by which all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhry who in former times were generally left under the Tyranny of their Lords &amp; Cheiftains and had no defence nor juſtice from the Crown, were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into his Majeſties immediate protection; The publick peace being thus eſtabliſhed, publick Juſtice was next ſetled by dividing all Ireland into ſhires, and erecting Circuits in every Province, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things therein according to the Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and laſtly the Eſtates and poſſeſſions of the Engliſh, as well as Iriſh, were ſetled throughout the Kingdom, to the great comfort and ſecurity of all men, and thereupon enſued the calmeſt and moſt univerſal peace for above forty years that ever was ſeen in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Yet the foundation thereof was not ſo ſtrongly laid, but it received a ſhake by the firſt Storm that threatned England: For being ingaged in a War with France and Spain about the beginning of the Reign of King Charles the I. 1627. there was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſending ſome additional Forces into Ireland for the ſecurity thereof, upon which a Propoſition was made to the chief of the Iriſh Nation by the Lord Deputy Falkland, for contributing a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſum of money toward the maintenance of thoſe Forces to be eſtabliſhed by the way of a ſtanding Army, to which they would not condeſcend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Toleration of Religion firſt obtained, though Arch-biſhop Uſher, then Lord Primate of all Ireland, in a great Aſſembly of Iriſh and Engliſh at Dublin, uſed many cogent Arguments to perſuade them to it, and among others, <q>That their being Romaniſts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57819:19"/>would not exempt them the more from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Common Enemy, as they might conjecture from the anſwer which the Duke of Medina Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia gave in this caſe in 1588. That his Sword knew no difference between a Catholick and an Heretick, but that he came to make way for his Maſter.</q> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other notable inſtances he gave whereby he prophetically intimated what afterward fell upon Ireland in 1641. when above one hundred and fifty thouſand Brittiſh Planters were moſt inhumanely maſſacred by the outragious Iriſh, without the leaſt provocation given to prepetrate ſuch wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd acts of Barbariſm.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to give an account of that diſmal Tragedy; I will make ſome brief deduction of ſome former Tranſactions in this Kingdom, and diſcover the beginnings and progreſs of the General Rebellion in 1641.</p>
            <p>Ireland for near five hundred years has continued under the Soveraignty of the Crown of England, and preſently after its firſt Conqueſt was planted with Engliſh Colonies, long ſince worn out or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally become Iriſh, and therefore hath in this laſt age been ſupplied with great numbers of People from England and Scotland to ſettle there. The Iriſh, as we have related, want not many Fabulous inventions to magnifie the Original of their Nation, but whether the Scythians, Gauls, Africans, Goths or ſome other Eaſtern Nations that antiently inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Spain, came and ſate down there is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain yet their Manners, Cuſtoms, words, names, and ſtill retained Ceremonies ſeem very much to demonſtrate their firſt riſe from ſome of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; For it may be conjectured that as the Eaſtern Parts of Ireland bordering upon England were firſt planted by the old Brittains, ſeveral of their words being ſtill in uſe; and as the Northern Parts were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57819:20"/>firſt inhabited by the Scythians, from whom it was called Scyteland or Scotland; So the South and more Weſtern Ports thereof were peopled by the Maritime Parts of Spain, being the next Continent, not by the preſent Spaniſh Nation, who are now a different mixture of People, but it is probable by the Gauls, who anciently inhabited all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts of Spain.</p>
            <p>The whole Kingdom of Ireland was divided into five principal Cheiftains, or Commanders, that is, Macmorough of Leinſter, Mac-cartye of Munſter, O Neal of Ulſter, O Connor of Connaught, and O Malaghlin of Meath, who were called Kings, but as they had neither Hereditary Right nor Lawful Election, ſo they were neither Anointed nor Crowned, but made their way by the Sword, and were inveſted with certain Barbarous Ceremonies, and ruled with all manner of Tyranny, the People being abſolute ſlaves to all the ſavage Cuſtoms practiſed under their Dominion, which continued till the reign of Henry II. King of England, in whoſe time the undertaking for the Conqueſt of Ireland, was very Succeſsful, being made by moſt Powerful, though private Adventurers upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Dormet Mac-Morough King of Leinſter, being forced to fly his Countrey by the Kings of Conaught and Meath, repaired to King Heary, then perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending his Wars in France, and earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored his Aid, for recovering his Territories, moſt Injuriouſly, as he pretended, taken from him. The King refuſed to imbark in the quarrel, yet graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Recommended the Juſtice of his Cauſe, to all his Loving Subjects, and aſſured them, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would Aſſiſt Dermot, ſhould have free Liberty to Tranſport their Forces, and be held to do very acceptable Service therein; Whereupon Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow Earl of Pembroke, reſolved as a private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57819:20"/>to Aid him with his utmoſt Power, and Dermot coming to him at Briſtol, an agreement was made, that Strangebow ſhould marry Dermots only Daughter Eva, and after his Death, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Kingdom of Leinſter, of which ſhe was Heireſs; after which, Strangebow ingaging ſome other private Gentlemen in the Deſign, they got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a party of 490 Men, which they Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in three Ships to Wexford in Ireland, and there joyning with ſome of Dermots Forces, they not only Reduced that Town, but ſoon after poſſeſt themſelves of all the Maritime Parts of Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>King Henry upon the News of the proſperous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of ſo large a Territory, by ſuch inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Forces, deſirous to ſhare with his Subjects, both in the profit and glory of ſo great an Action, Reſolved to make an Expedition thither in Perſon; when he Arrived there, the Preſence of ſo great a Prince, had ſuch a ſtrange Influence on the Minds of the rude Savage Natives, that partly by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Arms, and partly by his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in receiving them upon their feigned Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, he ſoon Subdued this Barbarous Divided People. This happened in 1172. the King found the Land good and flouriſhing with plenty of all kind of Proviſions, the Soil Rich and Fertile, the Air Sweet and Temperate, the Heavens ſafe and commodious, ſeveral Towns and Villages ſcattered up and down in ſeveral parts of the Countrey, but the Buildings ſo Mean and Contemptible, that when the King Arrived at Dublin, their Chief City, he found no place for Entertainment, but was obliged to ſet up a long Houſe made of Smoothed Wattles, after the manner of that Country, and therein kept his Chriſtmas; all their Forts, Caſtles, Stately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other Edifices, were afterwards Erected
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57819:21"/>by the Engliſh, except ſome of their Maritime Towns, which were Built by the Eaſterlings, which formerly Inhabited there; He found likewiſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Monuments of Piety, and other Remarkable Teſtimonies, that the Chriſtian Religion had been planted there about 400 years after Chriſt, by ſome Holy and Learned Men from Forreign Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Learned Author in his Obſervations upon the Cauſes of the ſudden Reducing of Ireland, gives this as one Reaſon thereof; That a Synod or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Clergy, being Aſſembled at Armagh, and that point fully Debated, it was unanimouſly agreed; <q>That the Sins of the People, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly their buying of Engliſhmen from Pyrates, and Detaining them under moſt miſerable Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, was one great occaſion of the Heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fallen upon the Nation, and that Heaven by way of juſt Retaliation, had now ſuffered them to be Reduced by the Engliſh,</q> to the ſame Slavery; Whereupon they Ordered all the Engliſh in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity throughout the Land, to be Releaſed; If ſo heavy a Judgment fell upon them for the hard uſage of ſome few Engliſh, what Expiation can they now pretend to make, for the Effuſion of ſo much Innocent Blood in 1641. when in two years time, above three Hundred Thouſand Proteſtants were cruelly Murthered in Cold Blood;</p>
            <p>King John came into Ireland in his Minority to

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57819:22"/>aforementioned, the reſt of that Nation were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reckoned Aliens, and abſolute Enemies, ſo that from Hen. II. to Hen.

It was declared High Treaſon to Marry with the Iriſh, or to let them Nurſe their Children, and to uſe the Iriſh Language, Names or Apparel was made a Premunire, that is, to loſe their Eſtates, and be perpetually impriſoned; And though in after Ages, the Engliſh endeavoured to Civilize the People, and introduce the Engliſh Laws, Language, Habit and Cuſtoms among them, thereby to reduce them to Civility, yet ſuch was their Rough, Rebellious Diſpoſition, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Malice to the Engliſh, that nothing could Attemper, or Reduce them to any Tolerable pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or perſwade them to live peaceably among them; So that in all times, as well when they were admitted into the Condition of Subjects, as while
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57819:23"/>they were Eſteemed and Treated as Enemies, they took all Advantages, moſt perfidiouſly to riſe up and imbrue their Hands in the Blood of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Neighbours, and Ireland hath long continued a true Aceldama, or Field of Blood, and a diſmal Sepulchre for the Engliſh Nation; for after their intermixing with the Iriſh, they Barbarouſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

King James at his firſt coming to the Crown, conceiving that the powerful Conjunction of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Scotland, would overcome the Iriſh, and contain them in their due Obedience, reſolved not to take any Advantage of theſe Forfeitures and great Confiſcations, which he was moſt juſtly Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to by Tyrones Rebellion, but reſtored all the Natives to the entire poſſeſſion of their own Lands; After which, for ſix years, the Countrey was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different quiet, when Tyrone made a ſecond Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and drew in the whole Province of Ulſter, who were abſolutely at his Devotion, to joyn with him; but his Plot failed him, for not finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Capacity to Reſiſt the Engliſh Forces, he fled into Spain, promiſing ſpeedily to return with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Succors, but by the care of the Government, this Deſigned Rebellion was quell'd in the beginning, and Tyrone never came back; After which, King James being juſtly provoked by the High Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of theſe Traytors, cauſed their Perſons to be Attainted, and their Lands to be Seized, and Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted them among Brittiſh Undertakers, many of whom came over and Setled in the Province of Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with their Families, and Built ſeveral good Towns and Caſtles, in divers parts of the Country, whereby much Civility was introduced, and the whole Kingdom began to Flouriſh in Coſtly Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all manner of Improvements, and the very Iriſh ſeemed to be much ſatisfied with the Peace and Tranquillity they enjoyed.</p>

            <p>The next Day News Arrived, that the Iriſh were Riſen in the Province of Ulſter, Plundering, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Maſſacring the poor Engliſh, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion appeared to be general, over all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern part of the Kingdom; and every Hour, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Arrived at Dublin, like Jobs Meſſengers, telling the Story of their own Sufferings, and the fearful Murthers of the Proteſtants, in all parts from whence they came. The Rebels grew ſtronger every Day, and by the latter end of October, had got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the Towns, Forts, Caſtles, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Houſes, in ſeven whole Counties, and half the County of Doun, except London-Derry, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, and the Town and Caſtle of Inniskilling; this impetuous Torrent of Succeſs, ſeemed to proceed from the great Security and Confidence the Engliſh had in the Iriſh, with whom they lived peaceably and quietly, and to whom they had not given the leaſt provocation: So that in the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they were ſuddenly ſwallowed up, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, before they could make any manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; For moſt of the Engliſh, having either Iriſh Tenants, Servants, Landlords, or Familiar Neighbours: So ſoon as the Country began to riſe about them, many fled to them for preſervation, and with great Confidence, put their Lives, Wives, Children, and all they had into their Power; but theſe generally, either betrayed them into the Hands of other Rebels, or moſt perſidiouſly Murthered them with their own Hands.</p>
            <p>The Frieſts had now influenced the Iriſh with bloody Maxims; and the Day before the horrid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57819:26"/>Maſſacre began, they gave the People a Diſmiſſion at Maſs, with full liberty, to go out and take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all their Lands; which they pretended were unjuſtly detained from them, by the Engliſh, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them: <q>That it was a Mortal Sin, to give any manner of Relief or Protection to the Proteſtants; and that they ought to ſpare neither, Man, Woman, nor Child: That they might lawfully Strip, Rob, and deſpoil them of all their Goods and Cattels; That the Proteſtants were worſe than Dogs; for they were Devils, and Worſhipped the Devil, and that the killing of ſuch, was an excellent preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt the pains of Purgatory, ſince the Bodies of ſuch Catholicks, as ſhould dye in this quarrel, would not be cold, before their Souls ſhould aſcend up to Heaven, without touching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Having thus received the Watch-word from their Prieſts, both as to time and place, they roſe up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, as it were by the ſame Spirit in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at one and the ſame time, Murdering and Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſome, and expelling others out of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; All Bonds of Faith and Friendſhip were now broken, the Iriſh Land-Lords made a Prey of their Engliſh Tennants; Iriſh Tenants and Servants made a Sacrifice of their Engliſh Landlords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; one Neighbour, was cruelly Murdered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Yea, the very Iriſh Children ſtript and kill'd the Engliſh Children, and it was eſteemed a Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work in any of them, that could by any means and ways whatſoever, bring an Engliſh Man to Slaughter. The Engliſh in the mean time, tho in ſome Churches and Caſtles, they made a very gallant Defence with ſmall Parties; yet did not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57819:27"/>draw together in any conſiderable Body, ſo as to withſtand the Numerous Forces of the Rebels: So that generally every Man ſtriving the beſt he could to ſecure his own Family, Goods and Cattel gave their Enemies opportunity to deſtroy them all; which they acted with great delight, to ſatiate their Ancient implacable Malice, declaring; <q>That it did them a great deal of good, to waſh their Hands in the Proteſtants Blood;</q> and ſo it appeared by the Examination of ſeveral Engliſh Perſons upon Oath, who gave the following account of ſome of their moſt Notorious Cruelties, and Barbarous Murthers.</p>
            <p>That in the County of Fermanah, multitudes were killed in cold Blood, ſome at Plough, others as they ſat peaceably in their own Houſes, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the way, without any manner of Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; at Liſgol Caſtle, above 150 Men, Women and Children, were Burnt or Smothered, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels having ſet it on Fire: In the Caſtle of Moneah, 90 Proteſtants were Murdered; and in the Caſtle of Tullah; which was delivered upon promiſe of fair Quarters, they firſt ſtript, and then Murdered them all without Mercy; At Liſſenskeah they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and kill'd above 100 Scots: This County was very well Planted by the Brittiſh Undertakers; but all of them and their Tenants in a very ſhort ſpace, were in a moſt horrible manner deſtroyed, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from their Habitations. They compelled one Middleton to hear Maſs; and to Swear never to alter from it, and immediately after, cauſed him, his Wife and Children, to be hanged up, and 100 Perſons more in that Town: There were a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, Women and Children carryed out at ſeveral times, and unmercifully drowned at Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnedoum Bridge, which was broken in the midſt, and 4000 more in ſeveral Parts of that Country,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57819:27"/>the Rebels thruſting them into the River, with their Swords and Pikes; and if any endeavoured to Swim, they knockt them on the Head, or Shot them: Among others, one Mrs. Campbell, being forcibly brought by them to the River, and finding no means to eſcape their fury, ſuddenly claſpt her Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one of the chief Rebels that was moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to thruſt her into the Water, and carryed him to the bottom with her, and ſo they were both drowned together. They burnt the Cathedral of Armaugh, and Mardered 500 Perſons there, and 48 Families were Murdered by order of Sir Phelim O Neal, who had Remained, Protected by him 3 quarters of a year before; John Cander being told by a Rebel, that he would not kill him, till he had ſaid his Prayers, the poor Man was no ſooner on his knees; but he inſtantly cut off his Head. Some of the Villains, when the Proteſtants deſired to make their Prayers before their Death: <q>told them that they ſhould bequeath their Souls to the Devil, and that they need not pray, for their Souls were with the Devil already; and with theſe words in their Mouth, would ſlaughter, and put them to Death.</q> Others they buryed alive, and ſome were twice or thrice hanged up, and others wounded, and left half Dead, crying out Lamentably; for ſome to come and Diſpatch them out of their Miſeries, by killing them: At Clownis in the County of Ferr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It would be almoſt endleſs, to give a particular account, of all the Deteſtable Cruelties and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders acted by theſe incarnate Devils, upon the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57819:28"/>Engliſh, of whom they deſtroyed, near three Hundred Thouſand in a few Months; being chiefly Animated thereto, by their Villainous Prieſts, upon the account of their Religion; and therefore, they often declared their Deſpight to the Bible, as being directly contrary to their Curſed Principles and Practices: In one place they burnt two Engliſh Bibles, ſaying, <hi>It was Hell Fire they burnt.</hi> They laid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a puddle of Water, and then ſtamping on it, ſaid, a Plague on it, This Bible hath bred all the quarrel: A Rebel perſwaded a Man and his Wife, to joyn with them in the Maſſacre, who proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that rather than they would forſake their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they would dye upon the Sword's point; he would then have had the Woman burn her Bible; but ſhe refuſed, ſaying, ſhe would rather dye, than do it: Whereupon they were both cruelly Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they Murthered Mr. Bingham, a Famous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and cutting off his Head, put a Gag in his Mouth, and laying the leaf of a Bible before him, bid him Preach, ſaying, his Mouth was open, and wide enough.</p>
            <p>During theſe horrid Barbarities, there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Indications of Divine Diſpleaſure, apparent in divers places, the truth of which was ſworn to, and affirmed by Witneſſes of Credit and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; As in the Province of Munſter, near the Silver Works; where while the Rebels were Maſſacring a great number of Proteſtant Men, Women, and Children on the Lords Day Afternoon, a moſt Loud and Dreadful Noiſe and Storm of Thunder, Lightning, Wind, Hailſtones and Rain happened, though it was fair all the Day before; which much affrighted the Murtherers themſelves, who confeſs it to be a ſign of Gods Anger againſt them, for their Bloody Cruelty; At Portnedown Bridge, where ſo many thouſand Proteſtants were drowned, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57819:29"/>remaining Inhabitants, were ſo Terrified with the noiſe of Spirits and Viſions for Revenge, that they durſt not continue thereabout; and ſome of the Rebels themſelves ſaid to others; that the Blood of ſome of thoſe that were knockt on the Head, and afterward drowned in this River, remained on the Bridge, and could not be waſht away: There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſometimes Men, ſometimes Women, Breaſt high in the River, with Hands lifted up, crying out with fearful Schreicks and Voices, Revenge. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Revenge; and it was not long, ere Divine Juſtice overtook them: Many thouſands of the moſt Notorious Murtherers, who periſhed by the Sword and Plague, that followed it; ſo that it was computed, that in a few years, ſcarce any of theſe Miſcreants remained alive; but were ſent to their own place to give an account of their Tremendous Brutalities.</p>
            <p>The King having made a Truce with the Scots, who were entred with an Army into England, to demand the Redreſs of their Grievances, and the Forces on both ſides being Disbanded; he made a Journey into Scotland, in the beginning of Auguſt, 1641. and continued there, till the latter end of October, when this Horrid Rebellion happened. Owen O Covally, the firſt Diſcoverer of the Plot, brought the firſt Letters to London, and received as a Reward, 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> in Money, and an Annuity of 200 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year; and preſently, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provided for the Relief of Ireland; and the Lords of the Council, and the Lords Juſtices there, had with the Arms that were in Dublin Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many well-affected Gentlemen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Active Commanders were ſent out of the City, to defend the adjoyning Places from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Rebels; at which time, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent over Twenty Thouſand Pounds, for a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57819:29"/>preſent ſupply; but could not relieve them with any Forces, till December following, when Sir Simon Harcourt Arrived with Seaſonable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of men and money, and Raiſed the Seige of Drogheda; which had been much ſtraitned by Sir Phelim O Neal, and the Rebels; and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh recovered Dundalk, Neury, and ſeveral other Towns and Caſtles out of their Hands;</p>
            <p>But though the Rebellion brake out in October 23. Yet the King, who was now returned from Scotland, did not proclaim them Rebels, till Jan. 1. following, and then gave ſtrict Command, that only 40 Proclamations ſhould be printed, and that none of them ſhould be Publiſhed, without the Kings Expreſs Order; which the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, afterwards Taxed him with; Who Replyed thereto: That he was unwilling to make the Iriſh Deſperate, and utterly undoe his Proteſtant Subjects, who were then too weak to withſtand ſo Potent a Rebellion; and that the Lords Juſtices of Ireland, required only 20, as many of themſelves well knew: Yet this proceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily increaſed the Jealouſies that began to ariſe between the King and his Engliſh Parliament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was publickly diſcourſt, that it had not been done at all; but that ſome Worthy Proteſtant Lords, had earneſtly adviſed him to proclaim them ſpeedily, that a better courſe might be taken againſt them, and to waſh off that foul Stain from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by proſecuting ſeverely, thoſe wicked Villains, who reported every where: <q>That they had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the King, to Seiſe upon the Holds of the Engliſh Proteſtants; that they were the Queens Souldiers, and riſe to maintain the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, againſt the Puritan Parliament of England: That they told the poor Proteſtants, it was for no purpoſe to fly for ſafety into England; for that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57819:30"/>Kingdom would be as much diſtreſt as theirs; and that the King intended to forſake his Parliament in England, and make War againſt them, and that then they would come over (having done their their Work in Ireland) and help the King againſt his Engliſh Parliament.</q> The Lords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſed him by all means, to purge himſelf of theſe Accuſations, than which there could not be greater on Earth.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Earl of Leiceſter was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Strafford being Beheaded ſome time before at Tower Hill; But the Relief of that Bleeding Kingdom, was much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the wide Breaches which daily happened between the King and the Parliament, particularly upon his going, Jan. 4. Attended with 300 Armed Gentlemen, into the H. of Commons, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding 5 Members to be delivered him, which the Parliament declared to be, <q>An High Breach of their Priviledges, a great Scandal to the King and his Government, a Seditious Act, manifeſtly tending to the Subverſion of the Peace, and an Injury and Diſhonour to the ſaid Members, there being no Legal charge, or accuſation againſt them; and that there could be no Vindication of thoſe Priviledges, unleſs his Majeſty would diſcover the Names of thoſe who adviſed him to ſuch unlawful Courſes:</q> After this, the Parliament conſidered of a Bill, for Preſſing Souldiers to be ſent out of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to Ireland, as being near; but the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt it, while it lay in the Houſe of Lords, as a Diminution to his Prerogative; Whereupon the Parliament in their Petition to him Aſſerted; <q>That the King by taking notice of a Bill; while in Debate in the Houſe of Lords, had broken the Fundamental Priviledge of Parliament; which he ought not to do, concerning any Bill, till it be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57819:30"/>preſented to him in due courſe of Parliament; and deſired Reparation.</q> They then deſired, that an Army of Scots ſhould be ſent thither; and that they ſhould have the keeping of the Town and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, of Carick-fergus; but the King ſaid, that he doubted this might be to the Damage of England; The Scots Commiſſioners replyed: <q>That they were ſorry, his Majeſty being their Native King, ſhould repoſe leſs Truſt in them, than their Naighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation had freely done:</q> So that at length, this was granted.</p>
            <p>It was thought to be the moſt Feaſible way for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Ireland, that proportions of Land there ſhould be ſhared among Engliſh Adventurers, proportional to thoſe Sums of Money they ſhould Subſcribe; that ſo, whoſoever in Perſon, or Purſe, ſhould aſſiſt in Conquering the Bloody Rebels, might be Recompenſed, if the Work were done; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were framed in Parliament to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which the King confirmed: Though at firſt he laught at them, and was heard to ſay: <q>That they were like to him, who Sold the Bears Skin, before the Bear was killed: At length an Act was paſſed for impowring the Parliament to carry on that War, till Ireland ſhould be declared wholy Subdued, and that no Peace nor Ceſſation of Arms ſhould ever be made with the Rebels, without conſent of both Houſes of Parliament.</q> The King then offered to go in Perſon thither; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament thought it not fit to hazard his Perſon in ſuch an Expedition.</p>
            <p>The Queen about February, went to Holland, carrying with her, moſt of the Crown Jewels, which ſhe had pledged for Money and Arms for the King her Husband; and for which, ſhe was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards voted a Traytor by the Parliament; the King having taken leave of her at Dover, went with the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57819:31"/>Prince and Duke of York to Theobalds, and from thence to Newmarket; where both Houſes Preſented him a Declaration, ſent by two Lords, in which they Repeat the old Grievances, the War of Scotland, the Rebellion in Ireland, his entring the Houſe of Commons, his causleſs fear of Reſiding near London to the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom, the hindring the Relief of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and incouraging the ill affected Party in the Kingdom: To which the King anſwered, with great Indignation, extenuating ſome things, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others, accuſing them for raiſing needleſs Fears and Jealouſies: After which, the King paſſed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North, to York: upon which, the Parliament voted, <q>That the Kings Abſence ſo far Remote from his Parliament, is not only an Obſtruction; but may be a Deſtruction to the Affairs of Ireland: That when the Lords and Commons in Parliament ſhall declare what the Law of the Land is, to have this not only queſtioned and controverted, but contradicted, and a command that it ſhould not be obeyed, is an High Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament. That they which adviſe the K. to abſent himſelf from his Parliament, are Enemies to the Peace of this Kingdom; and juſtly to be ſuſpected as Favourers of the Rebellion in Ireland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From York, the King ſent a Meſſage to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, April 8. 1642. That he would go in Perſon over to Ireland, againſt thoſe Bloody Rebels, and intended to raiſe a Guard for his Perſon in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, to carry thither of 2000 Foot, and 100 Horſe; whom he would Arm from his Magazine of Hull: But the Parliament having Intimation, that the K. deſigned to Seiſe that Magazine, to Arm himſelf againſt them, ſent Sir John Hotham thither, who refuſed to admit him Entrance; upon which the K. Proclaimed him Traytor, and complained to the Parliament of the Affront, who endeavoured to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57819:31"/>appeaſe him; but juſtified Hothams Act, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Proclaiming him Traytor, without proceſs of Law, was againſt the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and Laws of the Land;</p>
            <p>The King daily Summoned the Gentry of the Northern Counties to attend him, all York as a Guard for his Perſon, which he declared, was in danger from the Parliament, who thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <q>That it appears, that the King Seduced by wicked Counſel, intends to make a War againſt the Parliament, who in all their Conſultations and Actions, have propoſed no other end to themſelves but the Care of his Kingdoms, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all Duty and Loyalty to his Perſon: That whenſoever the King maketh War upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it is a breach of the Truſt Repoſed in him by his People, contrary to his Oath, and tending to the Diſſolution of the Government; That whoſoever ſhall Serve and Aſſiſt him in ſuch Wars, are Traytors by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; and have been ſo adjudged by two Acts of Parliament, 11 Rich. II. and 1 Henry IV. and that ſuch Perſons ought to ſuffer as Traytors;</q> the King Juſtified himſelf in his Declarations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, againſt the Parliament, which daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred each other: So that all things tended to an abſolute Rupture, and preſaged the Calamities of the Civil War, which ſoon after followed; For both ſides flying to Arms, and the Nation being divided into Parties, ſeveral bloody Battels were fought, and the whole Kingdom was in a Flame.</p>
            <p>In 1643. The Parliament of England invited the Scots to come in to their Aſſiſtance, with an Army of 21000. Horſe and Foot, ingaging to pay them an Hundred Thouſand pound, towards the Charge of Raiſing them: On the other ſide, the King to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the Proteſtant Army out of Ireland, for Aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57819:32"/>him againſt the Scots, concluded a Ceſſation of Arms for a year, with thoſe Rebels; and 3000 of the Engliſh Army were Imbarqued from thence, to joyn with the King; This Ceſſation was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the Parliament, ſince it was not only for the benefit of the Iriſh Rebels, who gave him 3000 <abbr>l.</abbr> for the Favour; but alſo directly contrary to the Act, which the King hath lately Signed: That no Ceſſation ſhould be made, without the conſent of both Houſes. Thus was Aſſiſtance brought to either ſide, and that Engliſh Army which for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a year, had fought Valiantly and Victoriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Rebels, was now brought over to fight againſt the Parliament of England.</p>
            <p>The War ſtill continued with much Vigor, and great Slaughter was made throughout the Kingdom; yet in the midſt thereof, ſome Glimmerings of Peace began to appear, for in 1644. Conditions were propoſed, both by the King and Parliament, and a Treaty began at Uxbridge, between Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners from both Parties, during which, the care of the War was not neglected on either ſide, the King endeavouring to bring over ſome Forces from the Duke of Lorrain, and ſome Iriſh to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and by his Letters to the Lord Lieutenant, to make a Peace with the Rebels, or at leaſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Ceſſation for a year; and to promiſe and grant them the free Exerciſe of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſuring them, that if by their Aſſiſtance, he could but finiſh his War in England, he would A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate thoſe Laws made againſt the Papiſts there: He gave thanks likewiſe to Muskeny Plumket, and others of that party, promiſing a Pardon for all that was paſt: But they were much troubled at the Treaty of Peace with the Parliament; being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one neceſſary condition thereof, muſt be the Vigorous Proſecution of the War in Ireland.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57819:32"/>The King to remove this fear, writ to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, <q>that he could not refuſe to make a Peace with his Parliament, only upon the account of thoſe Iriſh, it being a point not Popular: Yet from that conſideration, the Lieutenant might raiſe an Advantage, to haſten a Peace with them, it letting them know their own Danger, by being Excluded from all Hope of Pardon from the Parliament; For (ſaith he) if we agree upon all other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will not be convenient for me to diſagree, only concerning thoſe Iriſh: Therefore let them take what I offer, while time is, and haſten the Peace, and when once my Faith is paſſed, no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man force ſhall make me break it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen alſo being then in France, writing to her Husband, ſeemed to grieve much, that at Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, they were to Treat of Religion in the firſt place aſſuring him, <q>That if any thing ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholicks, ſhould be concluded, and yet a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57819:33"/>of Worceſter, a zealous Papiſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more acceptable with the Rebels; giving him full power to make a Peace; and indulge to the Iriſh, whatever might ſeem needful; and this was Tranſacted ſo ſecretly, that both the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Ormond, and the Lord Digby, Secretary of Ireland, were ignorant thereof, till it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſcovered and made publick: But the King finding it difficult to make ſuch a Peace, as would bring him certain Aſſiſtance otherwiſe, that he might throw all that Envy upon Glamorgan, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred him, unknown to the reſt; For ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſweetned with large promiſes (unknown to Ormond) might the better admit of Conditions juſt in ſhew, and openly excuſable; and the King might draw from Ireland, ſuch Souldiers as would more firmly adhere to his ſide, and whom he might truſt, (as being the greateſt haters of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtants, and diſpairing of Pardon) againſt the Parliament of England. He therefore gave Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Authority to Glamorgan, in theſe words.</p>

               <q>Charles by the Grace of God, King of England, &amp;c. Defender of the Faith; to our Truſty and well beloved Coſen, Edward Earl of Glamorgan, Greeting; Being confident of your Wiſdom and Fidelity: We do by theſe Letters, as if under our Great Seal, grant unto you, full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to Treat with the Confederate Roman Catholicks in Ireland, and to indulge them, all thoſe things which neceſſity ſhall require, and which we cannot ſo Comodiouſly do by our Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, nor our ſelf publickly own at preſent: Therefore We Command, that you do this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe with as much Secrecy as can be; Whatſoever you ſhall think fit to be promiſed in my Name, that I do atteſt upon the word of a King and a Chriſtian, to grant to thoſe Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57819:33"/>who by their Aſſiſtance, have abundantly ſhewed their zeal to us, and our Cauſe; Given at Oxford, under our Royal Seal, March 12. and 20 year of our Reign.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of theſe Powers, the Earl of Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan aſſured the King: He would Land 6000 Iriſh Papiſts in May following in Wales, and with the Tranſport Ships, block up Melford Haven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already to advance the ſame, thirty thouſand pound in Money, 1000 Muſquets, 2000 Caſe of Piſtols, 800.

                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> more. The K. likewiſe obliged the Earl of Antrim to joyn with the Marqueſs of Montroſs, then in Arms in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who ingaged to ſend 10000 Iriſh thither from Ireland, where the paſſage was ſhorteſtito aſſiſt him; but was very deficient therein, being ſcarce able to ſend 1200 thither.</p>
            <p>In 1644. the Parliament ordered the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord Macguire, and Collonel Mahon, who were Seiſed at Dublin, the Night before the Diſcovery of the Rebellion there, and had been in the Town ever ſince: They were now brought to their Tryal at the Kings Bench Bar at Weſtminſter, where Macguire inſiſted much upon his Peerage, but was over ruled; and both found Guilty of High Treaſon, by a Jury of Middleſex Gentlemen, and executed at Tyburn. In 1646. the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, endeavoured to make the Ceſſation with the Iriſh, a kind of a Peace; which they condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to, upon the following Propoſitions. 1. <q>That the Exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhould be in Dublin and Drogheda, and in the Kingdom of Ireland, as free as in Paris and Bruſſels. 2. That the Privy Council of Ireland conſiſt of Members True and Faithful to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and who have been Enemies to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57819:34"/>3. That Dublin, Drogheda, Trim, Newry, Cathirly, Carlingford, and all Proteſtant Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be Manned by the Confederate Catholicks, to keep the ſame for the uſe of the King, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdom. 4. That the ſaid Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Generals, Commanders and Souldiers, do Swear and Ingage to fight againſt the Parliament of England, and all the Kings Enemies; and that they will never come to any Agreement with them, to the prejudice of His Majeſties Rights and and the Kingdoms. 5. That both Parties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Oath of Aſſociation, ſhall to the beſt of their power and cunning, defend the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, the Kings Rights, and Liberties of the Subject.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Peace was kept by ſome of the moderate Papiſts; but was ill Reſented, both by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, and the Popes Nuncio, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiuenced the moſt Serious Papiſts: To put a ſtop to which, the Parliament ſent 2000 Men from Cheſter, under Colonel George Monk, with 3 Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Lord Lieutenant at Dublin; who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Deliver the City to them, without the Kings Command: So that after having Treated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, the Engliſh Forces were again Imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, and Landed at Belfaſt in Ireland, whereby they did very good Service againſt O Neal and his Fellow Rebels, who had of late been too Succeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt the Proteſtants: On the other ſide, the Nuncio's Party were ſo Elevated with the Hopes of ſhaking off the Engliſh Yoak, neither of the two Kingdoms being now in a Capacity to Relieve Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that the Romiſh Clergy thundered out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, againſt any that ſhould Acquieſce in the ſaid Peace and Agreement, and with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 17000 Horſe and Hoot, reſolved to Beſiege Dublin; which ſo ſtartled the Proteſtants, that the

The Cathedral Confederates, dreading a Storm from England, by Letters to the King, had importuned him to ſend for the ſaid Marqueſs of Ormond, late Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant; and ordered him to return again into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, upon their Ingagement and Proteſtation of Plenary Submiſſion to his Majeſties Authority, and to him as his Lieutenant, as being the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon for that Imployment: The Marqueſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly undertook it, and making an agreement with the Lord Inchequeen, and his Forces, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with thoſe of the Marqueſs of Clan-riccard, and the Earl of Caſtlehaven, and the Confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, who had proclaimed the Nuncio's Party Rebels and Traytors; being all joyned under his Command, they deſigned to Reduce Dublin, then poſſeſt by the Parliaments Forces; but differences ſoon aroſe about the Exerciſe of the Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57819:35"/>round the Town; The Beſieged perceiving the Danger of being thus cloſely confined, whereby they would have been prevented, of all Succour, both from Land and Sea; and knowing the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſss want of Horſe to Guard the New Forts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a deſperate Sally, to diſturb them, which they made accordingly, Aug. 2. 1649. about 8 in the Morning, with 1200 Foot, and 4000 Horſe, and finding the New Fortification ſlight, and the Reſiſtance weak, they ſoon were Maſters of it? from whence ſeeing the Iriſh fly in great Diſorder, they contrary to the firſt intentions, purſued the Beſiegers, even to the Avenues of their Camp, and being Animated by Collonel Jones, their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who had newly received a Supply of 3000 Men from England, they fell with ſuch fury upon the whole Army at Rachmines, conſiſting of 19000 Men, that in a ſhort time, they put them to the Rout, killing 4000 on the place, and making 2517 Priſoners, many of them Perſons of quality, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all their Cannon, and a Rich Camp to reward the Souldiers. Moſt of the Lord Inchequeens Foot that at firſt made ſome Reſiſtance, ſeeing the Day loſt, changed ſides, and joyned with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces. All this was done in ſo ſhort a ſpace, and with ſo little noiſe, that the Lord Dillon, and the reſt of the Marqueſs's Forces on the other ſide the River Liffy, knew nothing of it, till ſome run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways brought the News, the Iriſh making ſuch haſt home, in ſo pannick a fear, that the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant could not poſſibly rally them; and therefore fled, with a conſiderable Perty to Kilkenny, and there endeavoured to draw together as many of his Diſperſed Troops as poſſible, with which he ſpeeds away to Trim, and Drogheda, where he had notice, that Oliver Cromwell, the Parliaments General, was Landed with conſiderable Forces, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57819:36"/>on which he put a Garriſon of 300 Horſe, and 2500 Foot into Drogheda, which was thought ſufficient, and having furniſht it with what Proviſions he was able, and made Sir Arthur Aſton Governor, went from thence to Trim and Terrogan; About this time, London-Derry poſſeſt by the Parliament, and Beſieged by Ormonds Forces was relieved, and the Siege Raiſed, and not long after a Ship from Spain brought the Plague into Galloway, whereof a great number of the Iriſh dyed.</p>
            <p>Cromwell having refreſht his Men at Dublin, Marches to Beſiege Drogheda, and made himſelf Maſter of it in a little time, after a ſtout Reſiſtance from the Garriſon, putting moſt of the Officers, and every Tenth Souldier to the Sword, to terrifie others from making Oppoſition againſt his Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arms: Sir Arthur Afton, and ſeveral other principal Officers and Gentlemen, with near 3000 Souldiers being Slain; after this, Cromwell Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Town of Wexford, and ſoon reduced it, even before the Lord Lieutenants Eyes, with the loſs of 2000 of the Iriſh; upon this, the Marqueſs makes an Agreement with Owen O Neal, whereby the Ulſter Army were to joyn with his, under the Command of Luke Taaf, who was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Roſs; but ſoon forced to ſurrender it to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cromwell, after which, the Garriſons of Bandon-Bridge, Yough-Hall, Cork, Kingſale, and all the Engliſh Towns in Munſter, declared for the Parliament; and Cromwell marched to Beſiege Dungannon; but finding little hopes of reducing it quickly, he reſolves to go to Kilkenny, and the Marqueſs of Ormond, and the Lord Inchequeen retiring without hindring his March, he took in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtrong Towns and Forts, and at length At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks Kilkenny with ſuch Vigor, that he took it in 6 days time; after which, he Beſieges Clonmell, a

But he dying, Collonel Edmond Ludlow, Succeeded him, as Lieutenant General of the Army of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The War was now almoſt at at end, and the Lord Claurivard being in Galloway, ſends a Letter to Ludlow, to deſire him to appoint Commiſſioners to meet with others, for the compoſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this waſting bloody War, which Ludlow refuſed; but ſent him word: <q>That if the Iriſh would ſubmit, they ſhould have ſuch Articles and Conditions,</q> as were fit for them; This prevailed on ſeveral Parties, as the Lord Muskerries, Fitz Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks, and the Odroyrs to come in and ſubmit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, they might Tranſport their Forces into the Service of the King of Spain: The Earl of Ormond, and the Lord Inchequeen, not pleaſed with the ſace of Affairs, left that Kingdom ſome time before, and went to France; and in 1652. the remaining Iriſh under the Lord Clanrick, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received ſeveral Defeats by the Engliſh Forces, May 12. Galloway was Surrendred, and afterward the whole Country was Reduced to the Obedience of the Engliſh Parliament; Sir Phelim O Neal, the Arch-Rebel, being likewiſe taken, Hanged and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The laſt of the Iriſh, who held out in the Boggs and Faſtneſſes, was General O Brian, who at

Iriſh had departed the Kingdom, and the reſt were Tranſported into the Province of Connaught, environed on one ſide by the Sea, and lockt up by Rivers and Garriſons on the other, out of which they were not to ſtir, under a ſevere penalty: By this means, the Country was much Depopulated, and the Lord Fleetwood, and the Commiſſioners in Ireland ſent over Letters, that ſome Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies might be ſent thither to inhabit, great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges being offered to them that would Tranſport themſelves; and accordingly, went over to better their Fortunes, and in a ſhort time, this Haraſſed and Ruinated Kingdom, began to flouriſh again, both in Tillage, Buildings, and all other Accomodations.</p>

               <q>I have been very brief in relating any thing of the Affairs of England, or of the Actions of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell, in this Kingdom; having already publiſhed 2 Books, one, the Hiſtory of the Wars of England, with all the moſt Remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, till the Death of King Charles I.

            <p>In 1654. The Lord Fleetwood was Sworn Lord Deputy of Ireland, Serjeant Steel was made Lord Chancellor, and Serjeant Pepys Lord Chief Juſtice; Collonel Hammond, Corbet, with others, being made of the Privy Council, they ordered that March 1. 1654. ſhould be the longeſt time allowed to the Iriſh, to Tranſport themſelves out of that Kingdom, under very ſevere penalties. But a while

Henry Cromwell his Son, was made by him, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in the place of the Lord Fleetwood, all things ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing very quiet there: The ſame year, Arch-Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op Uſher of Armagh dyed a Prelate of incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Learning and Piety, upon whoſe Funeral, the Protector expended 200 <abbr>l.</abbr> After the Death of Oliver Cromwell, his Son Richard Succeeded; but in a ſhort time, was removed from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by M.

            <p>But the Nation being Diſcontented at the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fluctuations of the Government, the Long Parliament being ſoon after turned out again by the Army, the People generally deſired a Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And General Monk marching out of Scotland with his Army, and Reinſtating the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and reſtoring the Excluded Members in March 1659. they Diſſolved themſelves, having ſent out Writs for Electing a New Repreſentative to meet, April 25 following, and about the ſame time, Sir Charles Coot in Ireland, declares himſelf

A Coot, a Coot, and a Free Parliament: After this he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Sadler, and Sir Hardreſs Waller at Dublin, and immediately all Ireland declared themſelves ſatisfied in this Change, offering their Lives and Fortunes, in the Defence of the Parliament, then Aſſembled; and ſoon after a Convention was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at Dublin, in Nature of a Parliament, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſafety of the Kingdom, from whence the Lord Shannon, Sir John Clothworthy, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Aſton were ſent as Commiſſioners to England, where the Parliament Voted the Reſtoration of K.

But it was not long ere the great Inclinations to the Popiſh Partie in Ireland, were made apparent in the Court of England, and ſeveral Diſputes aroſe about the Settlement of that Kingdom; which were Debated before the King and Council, where the Lord Chief Juſtice Santry in an Excellent Speech, Repreſented to the Board, the Horrid Rebellion of 1641. with the Barbarous and Inhuman Maſſacres, which he had been eye witneſs of: In Oppoſition to which Sir Nich.

Whereupon we refuſe to admit the ſaid Marqueſs ſo much as into our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but on the contrary, committed him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to our Tower of London; where after he had continued ſeveral Months under a ſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, upon the continued Information of the ſaid Perſons, we ſent him into Ireland, without interpoſing the leaſt on his behalf, but left him to undergo ſuch a Trial and Puniſhment, as by the Juſtice of that our Kingdom ſhould be found due to his Crime, expecting ſtill that ſome heinous Matter would be objected and proved againſt him, to make him uncapable, and to deprive him of that Favour and Protection from us, which we know his former Actions and Services had Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. After many Months attendance there, and (w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>preſume) after ſuch Examinations as were requiſite, he was at laſt diſmiſſed without any Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and without any tranſmiſſion of Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to us, and with a Licence to Tranſport
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57819:39"/>himſelf into this Kingdom: We concluded that it was then time to give him ſome inſtance of our Favour, and to remember the many Services he had done, and the Sufferings he had undergone, for his Affections and Fidelity to our Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and our Self, and that it was time to redeem him from thoſe Calamities, which yet do lye as heavy upon him fince, as before our happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. And thereupon we recommended him to you our Lieutenant, that you ſhould move our Council there, for preparing a Bill to be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, for the Re-inveſting him the ſaid Marqueſs, in the poſſeſſion of his Eſtate in that our Kingdom, as had been done in ſome other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. To which Letter, you our ſaid Lieutenant returned us anſwer, That you had informed our Council of that our Letter, and that you were upon conſideration thereof, unanimouſly of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſuch a Bill ought not to be tranſmitted to us, the Reaſon whereof would forthwith be preſented to us from our Council. After which time we received the incloſed Petition from the ſaid Marqueſs, which we referred to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Examinations of the Lords of our Privy Council, whoſe Names are mentioned in that our Reference, which is annexed to the ſaid Petition; who thereupon met together, and after having heard the Marqueſs of Antrim, did not think to make any Report to us, till they might ſee and underſtand the Reaſons which induced you not to tranſmit the Bill we had propoſed, which Letter was not then come to our Hands. After which time we have received your Letter of the 18th of March, together with ſeveral Petitions which had been preſented to you, as well from the Old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Adventurers, as from the Lady Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs of Antrim, all which we likewiſe tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57819:40"/>to the Lords Referees; Upon a ſecond Petition preſented to us by Lord Marqueſs, which is here likewiſe encloſed, commanding our ſaid Referees to take the ſame into their ſerious conſideration, and to hear what the Petitioner had to offer in his own Vindication, and to report the whole matter to us, upon a third Petition herein likewiſe inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; we required them to expedite with what ſpeed they could. By which deliberate Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ours you cannot but obſerve, that no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity how juſt ſoever, could prevail with us to bring our ſelf to a Judgment in this Affair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very ample Information. Our ſaid Referees, after ſeveral Meetings, and peruſal of what had been offered to them by the ſaid Marqueſs, have reported unto us, That they have ſeen ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all of them the Hand-writing of our Royal Father to the ſaid Marqueſs, and ſeveral Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning his Treating and Joining with the Iriſh, in order to the King's Service, by reducing to their Obedience, and by drawing ſome Forces from them, for the Service of Scotland. That beſides the Letters and Orders under his Majeſty's Hand, they have received ſufficient Evidence and Teſtimony of ſeveral private Meſſages and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſent from our Royal Father, and from our Royal Mother, with the Privity, and with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the King our Father; by which they are perſwaded, that whatever Intelligence, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence or Actings, the ſaid Marqueſs had with the Confederate Iriſh Catholicks, was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or allowed by the ſaid Letters, Inſtructions and Directions; and that it manifeſtly appears to them, that THE KING OUR FATHER WAS WELL PLEASED WITH WHAT THE MARQUESS DID, AFTER HE HAD DONE IT, AND APPROVED THE SAME.</p>

This being the true State of the Marqueſs his Caſe, and there being nothing proved upon the firſt Information againſt him, nor any thing contained againſt him in your Letter of March 18; but that you were informed he had put in his Claim before the Commiſſioners, appointed for executing the Act of Settlement; and that if his Innocency be ſuch as is alledged, there is no need of Tranſmitting ſuch a Bill to us, as is deſired; and that if he be Nocent, it conſiſts not with the Duty which you owe to us, to tranſmit ſuch a Bill, as if it ſhould paſs into a Law, muſt needs draw a great prejudice upon ſo many Adventurers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are, as is alledged, to be therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. We have conſidered of the Petition of the Adventurers and Souldiers, which was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us by you; the Equity of which conſiſts in nothing, but that they have been peaceably in Poſſeſſion, for the ſpace of ſeven or eight Years, of thoſe Lands which were formerly the Eſtate of the Marqueſs of Antrim, and others, who were all engaged in the late Iriſh Rebellion; and that they ſhall ſuffer very much, and be ruined, if thoſe Lands ſhould be taken from them. And we have likewiſe conſidered another Petition from ſeveral Citizens of London, near ſixty in number, directed to our ſelf, wherein they deſire, that the Marqueſs his Eſtate may be made liable to the payment of his juſt Debts, that ſo they may not be ruined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the Favour of the preſent Poſſeſſors, who (they ſay) are but a few Citizens and Soldiers, who have disburſed very ſmall Surns thereon. Upon the whole matter no Man can think we are leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by our Declaration, and by the Act of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, to protect thoſe who are Innocent, and who have faithfully endeavoured to ſerve the Crown, how unfortunate ſoever; than to expoſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57819:41"/>to Juſtice thoſe who have been really and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Guilty. And therefore we cannot in Juſtice, but upon the Petition of the Marqueſs of Antrim, and after the ſerious and ſtrict Inquiſition into his Actions, declare unto you, That WE DO FIND HIM INNOCENT FROM ANY MALICE OR REBELLIOUS PURPOSE AGAINST THE CROWN; and that what he did by way of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, or Compliance with the Iriſh Rebels, was in order to the Service of our Royal Father, and warranted by his Inſtructions, and the Truſt repoſed in him; and that the Benefit thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to the Service of the Crown, and not to the particular Advantage and Benefit of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs. And as we cannot in Juſtice deny him this Teſtimony, ſo we require you to tranſmit our Letter to our Commiſſioners, that they may know our Judgment in this Caſe of the Lord of Antrim, and proceed accordingly. And ſo we bid you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily farewel.</p>

                  <p>On the 20. I the Lord Lieutenant, received His Majeſty's Letter of July 10. concerning the Marqueſs of Antrim; which I imparted to the Council; upon reading whereof at this Board we obſerving, that though in ſeveral other matters relating to the proceedings of His Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners appointed for executing the Act of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, his Majeſty vouchſafed to direct this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Commiſſioners: Yet that thoſe Letters concerning the Marqueſs of Antrim, are directed to us the Lieutenant and Council, requiring us to Tranſmit the ſame to the Commiſſioners, that they may know His Majeſties Judgment in the Caſe of the Lord Antrim, as it ſtands ſtated in thoſe His Majeſties Letters, and proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: We hence gathered, that His Majeſty did judge it fit, that thoſe His Letters for the Marqueſs of Antrim, ſhould be directed to us, to the end, that if we his Majeſties Servants here upon the place, ſhould find more in the Marqueſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trims Caſe, than are in thoſe Letters taken notice of either in relation to his Majeſty, or his Affairs, then in ſuch Caſe, we might Humbly Repreſent the ſame to His Majeſty; And as it was the Uſe and Cuſtom here in former Times, and particularly in the Times of his Majeſty's Royal Father of Bleſſed Memory: That if any Directions came from the King, which in the Execution thereof, might occaſion inconveniencies to his Majeſties Service, the ſame was ſtay'd, until the matter was by the Chief Governor here Humbly Repreſented to the King: So it is alſo agreeable to his Majeſties Inſtructions to me the Lord Lieutenant, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57819:42"/>in things relating to his Majeſty's Revenue, which likewiſe is the preſent Caſe: For his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Revenues are like to be hereby much leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moreover it is agreeable likewiſe with his now Majeſties gracious pleaſure, ſignified thither by the Lords of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council, by their Letters of Aug. 12. 1661. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the late Juſtices and Council; wherein it was declared, That his Majeſty and the Lords of the moſt Honourable Privy Council were well aſſured of a Demur the ſaid Juſtices and Council had made upon Letters from His Majeſty, and their Forbearance to proceed thereupon, till they ſhould receive His Majeſties further pleaſure: And therefore upon full conſideration thereof had at this Board, we humbly conceive, that it is our Duty to His Majeſty, to defer for ſome time, the Tranſmitting the ſaid Letters to the ſaid Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, till we ſhall have Repreſented to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that which appears to us here; which it ſeems was not made known to His Majeſty, or thoſe Lords of the Privy Council, to whoſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Majeſty refer'd the Marqueſs of Antrims Petitions, mentioned in his Majeſties Letters: We obſerve that his Majeſties ſaid Letters ſeem to be grounded on theſe particulars. 1. That after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Months Attendance here, and as his Majeſty is pleaſed to declare; that he preſumes that after ſuch examinations as were requiſite, the Marqueſs of Antrim was diſmiſſed hence, without any Cenſure, and without Tranſmitting any Charge againſt him to his Majeſty; and nothing proved againſt him on the firſt Information, nor any thing contained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in our Letters of March 18. 2. The Report made by theſe Lords of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council, to whom his Majeſty refer'd the Conſideration of the Lord of Antrims
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57819:42"/>Petitions: 3. That the Marqueſſes Caſe as it ſtands flated in thoſe Letters, is the true State of his his Caſe. As to the firſt we find, that the Lords of his Majeſties Privy Council, by their Letters of Dec. 19. 1660. directed to the Juſtices of this Kingdom, ſignified, that the Marqueſs of Antrim, then Priſoner in the Tower of London, Petitioned His Majeſty to be heard, as to his being Criminal in the Aſperſing the Memory of the late King our Soveraign; and their Lordſhips by theſe Letters, required the Juſtices with all convenient ſpeed, to ſend their Lordſhips Authentick Copies of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers whatſoever, under his own Hand, or any other which may any way relate to the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs his being guilty of ſo foul a Crime as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming his late Majeſty; and that the Juſtices ſhould cauſe all ſuch Witneſſes reſide in this Kingdom, who can alledge any thing to the proving thereof, to be examined, and the Examinations to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Lordſhips atteſted by us, and the Juſtices appointed to take the ſame; and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe Letters, the Juſtices cauſed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to iſſue under his Majeſties Great Seal to ſeveral Perſons, ſome of them Members of this Board, and ſome of His Majeſties Judges, and ſome of his Learned Council, to call before them, and examine Witneſſes upon Oath, concerning the Lord of Antrims Aſperſing the Memory of his late Majeſty, That thoſe Commiſſioners having examined ſeveral Witneſſes, and returned their examinations to the Juſtices, with their Letters of Feb. 20. 1660. directed to the Lords of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Privy Council, Tranſmitted the ſame to their Lordſhips. That March 29. 1661. it was ordered by his Majeſty in Council, that in order to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeding here againſt the Lord Antrim, the Examinations and other Papers ſhould be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57819:43"/>hither. Thus far the matter proceeded, before the Arrival of the Lord Lieutenant in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Aug. 18. 1661. the Lord Chief Juſtice San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made a report at this Board, of the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken concerning the Marqueſs, and upon his Petition it was ordered: That the Chief Juſtice ſhould Cancel the Recognizance acknowledged by the Marqueſs and his Sureties, and as to his being Criminal in Aſperſing and Defaming the Memory of his Majeſties Royal Father, we Humbly crave leave to ſend herewith the ſaid Examinations, and other Papers concerning the ſame; which we Humbly Submit to his Majeſty's Conſideration, and we confeſs we are not willing upon theſe Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Papers, to aggravate any thing againſt him; and therefore it was, that there was no cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor any Tranſmiſſion of charge againſt him to his Majeſty; and as to our Letters of March 18. we confeſs there is nothing contained therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, nor indeed, under favour, did we conceive it proper in theſe Letters, to object any thing of Crime to him: Our work in thoſe Letters, being but to inform his Majeſty, only of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars then under conſideration, and what occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon occaſion of two Petitions exhibited, the one by the Lady Marchioneſs of Antrim: the other in the Name of ſeveral Adventurers and Soldiers, and their Aſſignes and Tenants; for we did not imagine the Lord Marqueſs would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to put His Majeſty upon a difficulty of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Rule contrary to the Act of Settlement; but would have abiden the Tryal in the proper way preſcribed by the Act, wherein it is provided, that the ſaid Marqueſs ſhall be reſtored to his Eſtate in ſuch Manner and Form, and according to ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Method, and no other; as the Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Nettervile, and the Lord Viſcount Gilmoy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57819:43"/>ought by vertue of the Act to be reſtored; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we had no notice from thence, that the matters relating to the ſaid Marqueſs, were under Debate or Conſideration there; which might give us occaſion humbly to Repreſent to his Majeſty thoſe things which now for his Majeſties Service, we are neceſſrated to do.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, namely the report made, that thoſe of the Lords of the Council to whom his Majeſty refer'd the Marqueſſes Petition, we muſt acknowledge the juſtice of their Lordſhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, upon what appeared to them: But there are ſome which we do verily believe, were not made known to them; and which do appear to us here, wherein we may not be ſilent, without breach of Juſtice to his Majeſty: For I the Lord Lieutenant, do well know, that the Peaces made by me in 1646. and in 1648. in this Kingdom, and both derived by Authority from his Majeſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father, was both oppoſed by the Lord Marqueſs of Antrim, who continually ſerved with the Popes Nuncio and his Adherents againſt his Majeſties authority then intruſted with me the Lieutenant, and appeared active in all Aſſemblies and Councels, wherein he was preſent, in open oppoſition to all Members of thoſe Aſſemblies and Councils, who endeavoured to incline the People to Submiſſion to the Peace: when I the Lord Lieuterant labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earneſtly by all Juſt and Honourable ways and means to Reduce his Majeſties Subjects in this Kingdom, to their due Obedience to his Majeſty, and to give him aſſiſtance whereof he ſtood in need, in the greateſt, and moſt imaginable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and when the Marqueſs of Antrim and the Popes Nuncio, and Clergies Party and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, laboured induſtriouſly to withdraw them from their Obedience and Aſſiſtance to his Majeſty,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57819:44"/>and ſo far prevailed, that when things were in a tendency towards ſending Ten Thouſand Men to his Majeſties Aſſiſtance, the Lord of Antrim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly in the Confederates great Aſſembly, that not a Man ſhould go out of the Province of Ulſter, and in the end, both theſe Peaces were by that Diſloyalty to his Majeſty, and by the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Continuance of the ſaid Marqueſs, Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fruitleſs, and what great and general Evils followed thereupon to his Majeſty, and all his Kingdoms, we need not now repeat; whence it was, that in the Act of Settlement it is enacted; that ſuch as at any time adhered to the Nuncio's or Clergy's Party, or papal power in oppoſition to the Kings Authority, ſhall not be reſtored as Innocent Papiſts: And this being the Marqueſs of Antrims Caſe, how far it may be fit for his Majeſty (in the greateſt Humility we mention it) to direft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, that the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners upon theſe His Majeſties Letters ſhould proceed to find him Innocent (for ſo the Letter ſeems to imply,) and that, as we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, without giving any Latitude of power to the Commiſſioners to examine matter of Fact purſuant to the ſaid Act of Parliament: We humbly ſubmit to His Majeſties Great Wiſdom and as we humbly conceive, it is not to be imagined, that his late Majeſty a Prince of moſt Eminent Honour and Prudence, would privately intruſt the Marqueſs of Antrim to oppoſe the concluſion of thoſe Peaces, for the obtaining whereof, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had given publick authority to the Lieutenant; or that he ever gave any Subſequent approbation, which tended to his ſaid Majeſties utter reine; and if it ſhould be ſuppoſed that the Marqueſs his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Nuncio's and Clergies Party, though moſt irreconcileable Enemies to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57819:44"/>Crown and Intereſt, might have been allowed of by his ſaid Majeſty; upon the Marqueſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to imploy the Credit he ſhould thereby gain amongſt them, to diſpoſe them at leaſt to forbear that violent oppoſition to all Overtures tending to the Reduction of the Iriſh Confederates to their Obedience, and to the Aſſiſtance of his late Majeſty: It cannot be rationally ſuppoſed, as we humbly conceive; but that the Reaſon and End of the Marqueſs's Compliance, would either by his late Majeſty, for the better Management of the affair, or by the Marqueſs himſelf, for his Security and Exeneration, have been made known to me the Lord Lieutenant; the Marqueſs having frequent opportunity to do it: The concluſion of this point is, that as the Marqueſs his conſtant oppoſition to all the Motions of Peace ſet on foot, by virtue of authority derived from his late Majeſty, hath been made apparent to us by ſufficient proofs: So it is clearly manifeſted by his taking the Oath of Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, a Copy whereof is here incloſed, and that by the Adminiſtration of thoſe who when they had, by his Aſſiſtances prevailed in the Breach of the Peace, and of the publick Faith of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, aſſumed to themſelves in the year 1646. the Government of that Party, under the Name of a Supream Council; as alſo by his becoming one of that Council, and Signing ſevere Letters and Inſtruments, whereof ſome were directed to me the Lieutenant, and all this without any Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with me, or the leaſt private intimation, that his purpoſe in thoſe his proceedings, had any Authority from his Majeſty, or any reſpect to his Service: And as to the third, the two laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned particulars, do ſeem to us to manifeſt, that the Marqueſs's Caſe as it ſtands ſtated in theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not the whole ſtate of the Caſe, ſeeing thoſe

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57819:45"/>which we Humbly ſubmit to his Majeſties excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Judgment; and we deſire you to move his Majeſty for a Signification of his good pleaſure herein to us his Servants, as ſpeedily as with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may be, if his Majeſty in his Wiſdom, ſhall ſo judge fit and ſo we remain from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Chamber at Dublin.</p>

                  <p>EVer Honoured Sir, Laſt Thurſday we came to Tryal with my Lord Marqueſs of Autrim; but according to my Fears (which you always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be in vain) he was by the King's Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and Peremptory Letter of Favour, reſtored to his Eſtate, as an Innocent Papiſt. We proved eight Qualifications in the Act of Settlement againſt him, the laſt of which made him uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being reſtored as Innocent. We proved, 1. That he was to have a Hand in Surprizing the Caſtle of Dublin, in the Year 1641. 2. That he was of the Rebels Party before the 15th. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1643. Which we made appear by his hourly and frequent Intercourſe with Renny O Moore, and many others; being himſelf the moſt notorious of the ſaid Rebels. 3. That he entred
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57819:46"/>into the Roman Catholick Confederacy before the Peace in 1643. 4. That he conſtantly adhered to the Nuncio's Party, in oppoſition to his Majeſty's Authority. 5. That he ſate from time to time in the Supreme Council of Kilkenny. 6 That he ſigned that execrable Oath of Aſſociation. 7. That he was commiſſionated, and acted as Lieutenant General from the ſaid Aſſembly at Kilkenny. 8. That he declared by ſeveral Letters of his own pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, himſelf in conjunction with Owen Ro Oneal, and a conſtant Oppoſer to the ſeveral Peaces made by the Lord Lieutenant with the Iriſh. We were ſeven hours by the Clock in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Evidence againſt him; but at laſt the King's Letter being opened, and read in Court, Rainsford, one of the Commiſſioners, ſaid to us, That the King's Letter on his behalf was Evidence without exception, and thereupon declared him to be an Innocent Papiſt. This Cauſe, Sir, hath (tho' many Reflections have paſſed upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>Well might the Iriſh decline their Tryals by indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Juries, and Appeal to this Court of Claims, which the Lord Chief Juſtice Santry declared, was like the Uſurpers High Court of Juſtice, Arbitrary and Unlimited; and the Engliſh complained, that the Natives by this Illegal Court, were made Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though they were known to be deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Rebellion; for that it was beyond all peradventure, that not 10 of the Iriſh Papiſts were free from Rebellion and Murther, and moſt of them ſtood Indicted and Outlawed for Treaſon, and therefore diſpaired upon their Tryal at the Bar, to make any conſiderable defence: Upon this, a New Act was prepared to explain the former; But Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot (after Tyrconnel) being made a Principal Agent for the Iriſh, and they inſinuating themſelves into the favour of Rainsford (afterward made a Judge in England, for his good Services in Ireland) and the Commiſſioners of the Court of Claims, it ſo fell out, that though it was believed upon the Kings Reſtoration, there could not have been the twentieth part of Ireland gained from the Engliſh: Yet by Recommendatory Letters, and other Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the Court in England, there was almoſt an half of the Kingdom in value loſt, and at the ſame time, the moſt Innocent Iriſh loſt their Eſtates, and the greateſt Rebels, got twice more than they had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57819:47"/>before the Rebellion began; to ſuch a height was Popery already grown, which ſo far incouraged the Iriſh, that they often told the Engliſh, that in a ſhort time, the Proteſtants muſt be all of their Religion.</p>
            <p>In 1669. The Lord Roberts, was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; but ſoon recalled, and John Lord Berkley was ſent in his Room. In 1670. The Papiſts ſet up a pretence, that the King when in Exile, had ingaged to the French King, to reſtore the Iriſh to their Religion and Eſtates; which not being done, might occaſion a Breach with that Crown: Whereupon Commiſſions were ſent to Iriſh Papiſts, to make them Juſtices of Peace, in which Office they ſoon diſcovered themſelves to be ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and inſolent, that their proceedings were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor'd, not only by the Proteſtants; but the moſt thinking Iriſh: After this, there was a deſign for Regulating the Corporations of Ireland and the Popiſh Party began with Dublin where without any Legal proceeding or pretence, 7 of the Aldermen, and Sir William Davis the Recorder, who were oppoſite to the Romiſh Party, were turned out in a Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Irregular manner, and 7 of the Rabble put in their places; and Sir Ellis Leaton the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants Secretary, was made Recorder; and Papiſts were daily brought into the Common Council, to the great Terror of the Citizens, who plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the deſign was apparently level'd at the Foundation of the Proteſtant Intereſt and Religion, and for introducing Popery and Arbitrary Power; In which Opinion, they were confirmed by ſome Paſſages that happened about the ſame time; Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that Talbot the Popiſh Archbiſhop of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, in 1672.

               </gap>ſs they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57819:47"/>were ſent by Sir Ellis Leaton, with this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that he hoped to have High Maſs by Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas at Chriſt-Church: To effect which, ſoon after an horrid Plot was diſcovered, whereby all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were to have been barbarouſly Murthered; and the Signal appointed, to Diſtinguiſh the Iriſh from the Hereticks, was a Croſs of Straw, which the Prieſts earneſtly enjoyned every one to fix over their Doors, telling them the omiſſion thereof might be their Ruine; for where the Croſs were not found; they would be deſtroyed as Hereticks: But this Horrid Conſpiracy being happily Diſcovered, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Search, ſmall Croſſes of Straw not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were found on the Houſes of moſt of the Iriſh in the Province of Munſter: But the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ireland was at that time ſo Popiſhly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they would not incourage the further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thereof; and thoſe that appeared earneſt in laying it open, had their Cattel ſtole, and were threatned to have their Houſes burnt; ſo that the whole Villainy was huſht up in ſilence.</p>
            <p>In 3673. The Earl of Eſſex was made Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of Ireland, the proceedings in the former year, being thought by Courts of England too bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced; This worthy and prudent Governor, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Affairs with ſo much skill and integrity, that the Papiſts could hope for no Advantage, whilſt he held the Sword; therefore one Sheredon, and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coleman, were thought fit Inſtruments to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs Affairs, and manage the Catholick Intereſt; but by the unparallel'd Conduct of this prudent Earl, he ſo far outvy'd the Romiſh Politicks, as to Cajole that Party into an approbation of thoſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; which proved fatally Deſtructive to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, of which at length, the D. of York was ſo ſenſible, that he became his inveterate enemy, and ſet up private deſigns againſt him; and at length
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57819:48"/>prevailed to have him recalled; and in 1677. the Duke of Ormond was again ſent Lord Lieutenant thither.</p>
            <p>This year the Papiſts ſet up another Project, which was that the French ſhould make ſome new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for the Iriſh, upon pretence of the Articles made by King Charles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. in their favour, and the King of England was to admit the French to Land Men: The Earl of Tyrone, the Lord Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>as and others, were alſo to raiſe Men in Ireland, in order to make a diverſion to the putting the Popiſh Plot in force in England; and an Inſurrection was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned at the ſame time in Ireland; the King was unacquainted with the chief part of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the Duke of York having undertaken to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him, if he ſhould hear of the Iriſh Intreague; but this was divulged by ſome of the Iriſh, and the King was hardly prevailed with, not to believe it; at length the King and Council fearing ſome danger from Ireland, the Duke of Ormond was ſent thither, and the Duke of York did not think it ſeaſonable to oppoſe it; but yet prevailed ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the King, that he ſent Orders for raiſing Men in Ireland, upon pretence of Forreign Service; they were all Papiſts, except ſome Officers who were ready to be ſo; but the Lord Lieutenant would not deliver them Arms; ſo they were exerciſed with Sticks;</p>
            <p>The next year, 1678, the Popiſh Plot was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in England; and ſoon after that in Ireland, which was detected by thoſe of their own Party and Religion, not one Proteſtant appearing as evidence againſt them: Upon which, Orders came from England, for Diſarming all Papiſts; but their Friends at Court, had given them timely notice to conceal them, ſo that not above 150 Arms were found among all the Papiſts in Ireland, they hiding them in Boggs,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57819:48"/>and other ſecret places without any Damage; the Lord Brittas and others eſcaped into France, the Earl of Tyrone was committed to the Gate-Houſe; Talbot (ſince Tyrconnel) with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Popiſh Archbiſhop, were impriſoned in Dublin Caſtle, where the laſt dyed: The Duke of York was ſent to Flanders, and all things appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Parliament of England were very buſie in ſearching into the bottom of the Popiſh Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and found many Great Perſons concerned therein; ſeveral Papiſts were executed for the ſame; but ſtill the Court endeavoured by all manner of Arts to obſtruct any further Diſcoveries, the Duke of Yorks Intereſt ſtill prevailing, who was come from Flanders; but upon the ſitting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was obliged to go to Scotland, from whence he ſent private Encouragements to the Iriſh Papiſts, not to deſpair of retrieving all again: But the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh there were very ſecure, as judging themſelves happy under the peaceable Government of the D. of Ormond, and their Intereſt in Ireland ſeemed more firm than ever; becauſe they were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this late Conſpiracy of the Iriſh, would prevent the Kings ſhewing them any kindneſs for the future; the Lord Lieutenant likewiſe procured a Grant for calling a Parliament there, the News whereof ſo alarm'd the Duke of York, that he came with all ſpeed from Scotland to prevent it, which he likewiſe effected, and the Iriſh afterward boldly affirmed, <hi>That there would be no Parliament, till the Duke came to the Crown;</hi> which they ſeemed to believe, would be very ſhortly, and accordingly the Death of King Charles the II. happened in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57819:49"/>1684. following, which ſtill remains a Myſtery, though the Papiſts in Ireland for ſome time before, could fix upon the utmoſt period of his Life: And now the long looken for day was come, which ſo Tranſported them after all the Dangers and Difficulties they had met with, that they could hardly contain their joys within any bounds.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as King Charles II. was Dead, the Duke of Ormond was removed from the Government of Ireland; and upon his Arrival in England, found King James inclined to ſuch violent Courſes, as it is thought broke his Heart, he dying ſoon after: Before his going, he called his Officers of his Army together, and taking a glaſs of Wine in his Hand, <q>Look here Gentlemen (ſays he) they ſay at Court I am now become an old Doting Fool, you ſee, my Hand doth not ſhake; nor does my Heart fail, nor doubt I, but I ſhall make ſome of them ſee their miſtake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Primate, and the Lord Granard, were now made Lords Juſtices of Ireland; but the dayly reported inſolencies of their Iriſh Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as the Commonalty, ſoon made them weary of their Government; For they repaired in great Numbers to Dublin, and in all places reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed the Engliſh, with the moſt impious Calumnies and Reflections; and thoſe that refuſed to drink Confuſion to all Proteſtants and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, were ſeiſed with Warrants, and threatned to be Murthered: The Defeat of the Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth in 1685. heightned their Rage more, and made them Contrive Helliſh Plots againſt the Lives and Eſtates of the Proteſtants, under the pretence that they deſigned to Maſſacre the Iriſh, though they themſelves knew too well, that ſuch an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Attempt was as impoſſible, as Ridiculous, if any ſhould have been ſo Villainous to have contrived it,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57819:49"/>ſince in the moſt parts of the Kingdom, the Iriſh were vaſtly more numerous than the Engliſh, nay in ſome Countries an 100 Families for one.</p>
            <p>After this, Tyrconnel began to Model the Army and Diſarm the Proteſtants, upon pretence that Monmoths Rebellion had infected many, aad might delude more in that Kingdom; and the Iriſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that if any Arms were found in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Hands, they would be judged Perſons Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the King and his Government; which ſo affrighted many, that they brought in their own Arms, and delivered them up to the Papiſts: After which, Tyrconnel went to England, accompanyed with one Neagle, a cunning Iriſh Lawyer, who publiſhed an account of the injuſtice of the Act of Settlement, reflecting with all manner of Invectives againſt King Charles II. But matters being not ripe enough in England King James did not think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to propoſe Tyrconnel for Lord Lieutenant at preſent; and therefore it was contrived by the Popiſh Cabal, that the Earl of Clarendon ſhould go over Lord Lieutenant and Tyrconnel Lieutenant General of the Army.</p>
            <p>When the Earl arrived there, the Engliſh were much Diſcouraged, becauſe of his Relation to the King; but their Hopes were extreamly revived, when they found him acting with inviolable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to the Proteſtant: The Iriſh Grandees were very little concern'd at it, proceeding ſtill with all violence, in ruining the Proteſtants Intereſt, and animating their vaſſals with hopes, that he would ſoon be removed, the Iriſh Compoſing Barbarous Songs in praiſe of Tyrconnel; and that his Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Hand, ſhould Deſtroy the Engliſh Church: They declared publickly, <q>That they liked no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but that of France; and that they would make King James as Abſolute as King Lewis; that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57819:50"/>they would ſhortly have the Engliſh Churches and Houſes, and if they ſuffered them to live, would make them <hi>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> That Ireland muſt be a Catholick Country, and that they would make the Engliſh as poor Devils,</q> as when they came firſt thither: And of this they were ſo confident, that the moſt Serious amongſt them, privately adviſed their Proteſtant Friends, to change their Religion; <q>For ſaid they, you will be forced to do it in a while, and if you delay a little time, it may be too late; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may not be accepted, for no Proteſtant muſt expect to enjoy any thing in this Kingdom, and we reſolve to reduce all things to the State they were in before Poinings Act in King Henry 7 time:</q> Yea King James himſelf, and his followers uſe to ſay, <q>That the Iriſh muſt be reſtored to their former Power, Eſtates, and Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</q> and when the Engliſh Objected, that their proceedings were Arbitrary and againſt Law, they called them Traytors, <q>Crying, Damn your Laws, it is the Kings Pleaſure it ſhould be ſo; and you are all a company of Rebels, becauſe you are not of the Kings Religion; and will not own his Will and Pleaſure,</q> to be above all Laws.</p>
            <p>But the Engliſh Roman Catholicks, were not ſo confident of their Game, ſo that a general meeting of the chief of them at the Savoy, before Father Peters, they ſeemed very doubtful of the Kings Capacity, or willingneſs to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of ſecuring the Catholick Religion in his Reign, conſidering his Age; and the almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable difficulties, they were to encounter with to effect it; and therefore moved the King, that their Eſtates might be ſecured by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with Liberty of Exerciſing their Religion only privately; but Peters oppoſed this, as a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57819:50"/>too Worldly, adding, that if they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his meaſures, he doubted not to ſee the Holy Church Triumphant in England: Other Papiſts deſired the King they might have Liberty to ſell their Eſtates, and retire into France; and by his Interceſſion, might be provided for in that Kings Dominions; To which he replyed, <q>that before their deſires came to him, he had often thought of them, and had as he believed, provided a ſure Sanctuary for them in Ireland, if all thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhould be blaſted in England, which he had made for their Security; and of whoſe Succeſs he had not reaſon to deſpair,</q> adding many zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Expreſſions of his extream kindneſs for the Catholick Church: <q>As that he reſolved rather to dye a Martyr, than not to ſettle the Roman Religion, and that he would chooſe to dye the next day, that deſign being compaſſed; rather than live 50 years without effecting it, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been almoſt a Martyr for the Catholick Cauſe, which had been the occaſion of all his Troubles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of theſe Reſolutions, the King gave himſelf wholly up to the Conduct and Counſels of the Furious Jeſuits; being entred into their Society, and was become a Lay Brother of that Order, and conſequently judged it Meritorious to extirpate and deſtroy Hereſie, eſpecially being told, <q>That it would be a moſt glorious Action; and that no doubt, he would be Canonized for a Saint, if he could Reduce 3 Kingdoms to their Ancient Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Holy See from which they had been ſo long Apoſtates; and had Nurſt up ſo many Damned Hereticks, to the Diſturbance of Holy Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the preſent Lord Lieutenant, being an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the Vigorous progreſs of Popery in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57819:51"/>land, the Jeſuits reſolved to remove him, of which deſign, a Perſon of Honour acquainted the King; who abſolutely denyed there was any ſuch intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that he had any thoughts of it, nor did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ever ſhould (whilſt both lived) remove him from that Government, though the Papiſts in Ireland confidently affirmed: That he had before given aſſurance to Father Peters, that Tyrconnel ſhould be Lord Deputy; and accordingly in 1686. he obtained that Government againſt all oppoſition, the News of which ſo ſurprized the Proteſtants in Ireland, that almoſt all that were able, Deſerted the Kingdom, and flockt in great numbers to the Iſle of Man, Scotland, and other places, ſo great was their Terror and Conſternation at theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tydings, and the diſmal effects which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his Management of Affairs; at length Tyrconnel arrived there, after having been kept a conſiderable time at the Sea ſide by contrary winds; which ſeemed a Signal Act of providence, to give warning and opportunity to the People, to fly from the judgments juſt ready to fall upon that diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Kingdom: The Lord Clarendon Surrendred the Sword to him, with an Admirable Speech, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that as he had kept an equal hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the Roman Catholicks; ſo he hoped his Lordſhip would do to the Proteſtants: But Popery was the Scene which muſt be Acted, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Trembled at the Terrible Conſequences thereof, whilſt the Iriſh Triumpht and inſulted over their Dejection, reproaching them both as Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Proteſtants, and uſually calling them Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Dogs, and Damned Hereticks: Yea, ſo Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous were their Affronts and Indignities that the Engliſh were daily afraid of a general Maſſacre, to be inhumanly put in Execution againſt them.</p>
            <p>Tyrconnel now places Popiſh Judges and Officers
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57819:51"/>in all the Courts of Judicature; and then proceeds againſt the Charters of all the Cities and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Kingdom: He endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common-Council of Dublin to Surrender theirs to the King; but meeting with much Oppoſition therein, he in a Rage told them, <q>that this was the continuance of their former Rebellion, having turn'd out all the Loyal Subjects in the laſt War of Ireland, and would do ſo now,</q> if it were in their power; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they produced a Letter from King Charles I. Dated at Oxford, containing great acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Signal Loyalty and Faithfulneſs to him, with High Aſſurances of being Eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, if he were again Reſtored to his Crown: But this availed nothing; for the common ſaying of the Iriſh was, <q>that K. James would regard no Man for any Service formerly done to him, his Father, or Brother; but only for future Service that he expected from them.</q> So that though the Citizens of Dublin ſent a Gentleman on purpoſe to the K. with a Petition, and Repreſentation of their Caſe, yet he would not regard him; but upon firſt ſight askt him, if he had the Lord Deputies leave to come with this Petition; and that he had thoſe in Ireland that underſtood the Law better than himſelf, and ſo turned from him; and he was forced to go back again <hi>re infecta:</hi> Yet the City of Dublin was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to betray their Liberties; but imploy'd the Council to defend their Charters; but theſe Judges who had already broken through all incloſures of Law; and Trampled upon the known Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, that they were oppoſite to their Popiſh and Arbitrary Deſigns, over ruled all their Pleadings, and gave Judgment againſt them, to the univerſal exceſſive Joy of the Iriſh; and great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Proteſtants. Conſonant to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57819:52"/>againſt Dublin, was Judgment given againſt all the Charters of the Kingdom, except thoſe who quietly Surrendred them.</p>
            <p>The New Lord Deputy, now choſe him a Privy Council, that all but three, had ſcarce common Senſe, of which two of them would often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ſaying, that nothing could paſs at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Board of publick concern; but their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt firſt ask Teige, 'if that would not ſpoil his Potato Garden; but however they all agreed to inſlaven and beggar their Country, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Trade, as appeared by Tyrconnels firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, with the Advice of his Council, to break an Act of Parliament in taking off the Duty of Iron, and this without asking the King leave; but as ſoon as it was heard of in England, a Proclamation came from thence, forbidding this wiſe Act made by theſe Notable Stateſmen; and the Lord Bellaſis ſwore in Council; <q>That Fool in Ireland, was Fool and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enough to ruine 10 Kingdoms:</q> And Father Peters ſecretly Reprimanded him for his Political Blunder; and writ to him, if he acted not with greater Caution, the King could not poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him in that Government. This with the vaſt numbers of People that Deſerted the Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tyrconnels coming Lord Deputy thither, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Towns and Cities were made almoſt Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and Traffick ſo ruined, that the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was ſunk incredibly from the former value, were ſo ſtrongly preſſed againſt him at the Engliſh Privy Council to his Diſadvantage, that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Favour of K. James, to meet and confer with him at Cheſter, carrying along with him Judge Rice for his Councellor, and a Subtle Fellow, who told the King ſo many fine Stories, there being none to contradict him, that he was diſmiſt, contrary to the hopes and expectations of many who thought
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57819:52"/>he would never have returned again L. Deputy. When he took leave of ſeveral Privy Counſellors and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, at his going to wait on King James at Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Aug. 1687. He ſaid, <hi>I have put the Sword in your Hands:</hi> And then in his uſual Stile, <hi>prayed God to damn them all, if ever they parted with it again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During Tyrconnels ſtay here, the New Judges went their Circuits, wherein they diſcovered the moſt groſs partiality imaginable; for though they found the Jayls full of Tories and Iriſh Robbers committed for ſeveral Notorious Crimes, yet with the Aſſiſtance of Iriſh Sheriffs and Juries, they were moſt of them Diſcharged, without puniſhment, either being indicted by wrong Names, or elſe by taking off the Proſecutors with Threats; That if they proceeded, their Cattel would be ſtoln, their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes burnt, or their Throats Cut, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: And this was done in purſuance of one of the Lord Deputies Inſtructions from Court to them; that they ſhould by all poſſible means weaken the Proteſtant Intereſt, which they ſo effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that no Englſhman was ſecure of any thing he had, by their Exorbitant proceedings againſt them: So that had theſe Barbarous Injuſtices, and publick Oppreſſions and Violences in the ſeveral Law-Courts (even ſuch as never were till then heard of among Chriſtians) continued but a few years longer, theſe without other means, might have wholy Reduced the Kingdom into Iriſh Hands; it being obſerved, that never one Cauſe came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them upon a Tryal for Land; but the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was conſtantly given in favour of the Iriſh.</p>
            <p>As to the Army in Ireland, of which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſomething before, I ſhall add, that when K. James came to the Crown, they conſiſted in about 7000 Men as cordial to his Intereſt as poſſible, both
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57819:53"/>Officers and Souldiers Reſpecting him as their Maſter and Father; and ſhewed a great forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have aſſiſted him againſt Monmoth and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile: Yet he was no ſooner ſetled in the Throne; but he began to turn the moſt zealous of them out of his Service; becauſe he could not expect they would be uſeful to him in deſtroving the Proteſtant Religion and Liberties of the Subjects, which was the Service he expected from them; and therefore took ther Troops away, and gave them to perſons of mean or broken Fortunes, and ſome of them unqualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, and no conſideration was had to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty or Merit, unleſs a Man were a Papiſt; of which there were too many Notorious Inſtances: And the manner of their being Diſcarded, was with ſo much falſhood and Barbarity from Tyrconnel, as might have ſhaken the Obedience of any Army but this in the World; and cauſed them to have diſpatcht ſo falſe a Wretch, for in the Morning he would take an Officer into his Cloſet, and with his uſual Oaths, Curſes and Damnations, would profeſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kindneſs and friendſhip, aſſuring them of the Continuance of their Commiſſions; and in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, would Caſhier them with all manner of Scorn and Contempt; nay, while he was Careſſing them, he had actually given away their Commands. As for the Soldiers and Troops, he Marched them to ſome place ſo far diſtant from their Quarters, that they were not much known; and there after great Hardſhips, ſtript the Foot of their Cloaths, which they had payed for, and the Troopers of their Horſes, Boots and Furniture bought with their own Money; and turned them off to walk Barefoot ſome 100, others 150 Miles to their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Homes: And though they were promiſed ſomething for their Horſes, yet their Attendance coſt them twice as much as they expected, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57819:53"/>moſt of them after all, got nothing; By this means 2 or 300 Proteſtant Gentlemen, who had laid out great part of their Fortunes, and Contracted Debts to obtain Commiſſions, were not left worth any thing; but were turned out without reaſon, or any conſideration, and 5 or 6000 Soldiers ſent a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; an Hardſhip perhaps, never put upon an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before, for no other reaſon; but becauſe they were Engliſh-Men and Proteſtants; and Iriſh men and Papiſts were by K. James put in their places, clearly Demonſtrating, that he had no regard to the Laws, or the Preſervation of that Kingdom; and that he abſolutely deſigned to Ruin the Proteſtant, and Advance the Popiſh Intereſt in Ireland: And the ſame Fate attended all the Proteſtant Civil Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ſeveral of them being outed, though they had places by Patent for Life, Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, Officers of the Revenue, &amp;c. who were all changed for Roman Catholicks, and this before the News of the Glorious Expedition of his now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Prince of Orange, and without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or the leaſt pretence of Diſloyalty.</p>
            <p>Dec. 9. 1687. Being Sunday, in the Morning happened ſuch an Inundation of Water at Dublin, as was never known before, carrying away Stone Bridges, overflowing Houſes, for 3 Days together, ſo that a great part of the City was much inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged thereby to their great Detriment and loſs, and was the more remarkable; becauſe no great Rain, only a few ſmall ſhowres had fallen the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight before; which ſeemed to preſage the deluge of Troubles, that were impending over the poor Engliſh in that diſtreſſed Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Earl of Caſtlemain being returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from his Embaſſy to the Pope, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Preferment, complained to the Pope, who writ to his Nuncio to Addreſs the King in his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57819:54"/>behalf; and being ſeconded by Father Peters, it was reſolved in the Cabinet Council, Dec. 23. that Jefferies the Lord Chancellor, for tampring in the buſineſs of Magdalen Colledge, ſhould be put out, and 3 of the Lords of the Treaſury, be made Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, and that Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhould be Lord Treaſurer, Peters roundly telling the King, <q>that the moſt effectual means for accompliſhing his Deſign of Eſtabliſhing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, was to let his Prime, Miniſters, and the World underſtand, That no Service they had or could do ſhould protect them, or be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of any account, if they boggled in the leaſt Tittle or Circumſtance relating to the Catholick Cauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill the Furious Jeſuits and their Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were very much unſatisfied, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had a Catholick King upon the Throne, yet the Popiſh Religion made but ſmall progreſs, and there was but a mean harveſt of Converts to the Roman Faith; Nay, not in Ireland, where all the power both Civil and Military, was in their Hands; hereupon a Project is contrived to deſtroy the Act of Settlement there, in hopes the Proteſtants would Rebel, and Forfeit their Eſtates, whereby they ſhould have an opportunity totally to extirpate them out of that Kingdom; and ſo be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a ſhort time, to ſubdue England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land likewiſe: In Order hereto the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Nugent, Lord Chief Baron Rice and Neagle, drew up the Form of an Act, which in the nature of it, gave the whole Lands of Ireland into the Hands of the King, and though the Catholicks were to have but half their Eſtates, yet the other part was under ſuch qualifications, as the King might diſpoſe of them to thoſe who were moſt Obedient and Uſeful to him: This was brought over by theſe 3, who were called the Iriſh Ambaſſadors, and at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57819:54"/>length approved of by Father Peters, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King with ſtrong Aſſurances; that if he would but call a Parliament there, they could have whom they pleaſed elected, all Corporations being already put into Popiſh hands, and all the Sheriffs of Counties, Papiſts; who would be ſure to make returns as they thought fit.</p>
            <p>King James who was become a Vaſſal to the French King, durſt not refuſe their Propoſals, for fear of diſobliging him; and having (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly did) debated it in the Cabinet Councel; it was reſolved to be brought into the Privy Council, which the King did accordingly; and being read, the Lord Bellaſis paſſionately inveighed againſt it, ſaying; <q>That if ſuch Deſigns as theſe were incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, the Catholicks of England had beſt in time look out for another Country, and not ſtay to be a mad Sacrifice for Iriſh Rebels;</q> others ſeconded it, and none durſt offer any thing in behalf of it; afterwards the 3 Iriſh Ambaſſadors had Audience at the Council, where Rice ſpoke in the behalf of the reſt; but the Lords Bellaſis and Pours called him Fool and Knave, even in the Kings preſence: <q>Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis bidding them make haſt to the Fool their Maſter, and bid him next Meſſage he ſent, to imploy Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Men,</q> and upon a more honeſt Errand; and every one fell ſo violently upon them, that they kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Kings Hand and departed, he himſelf not ſpeaking a word; but inſtantly breaking up the Council: And the noiſe of their Buſineſs being known abroad, the Boys in the Streets run after the Coach, where Rice and Nugent at any time were with Potatoes ſtuck in ſticks, crying out, make way for the Iriſh Ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>In 1688. The Joyful News of the Birth of the ſuppoſed Prince of Wales arrived there, about the ſame time with that of the Impriſoning the Biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57819:55"/>in the Tower, which filled them with ſuch exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they could hardly bear it, Glorying, <q>They had now a Prince, who would become a Patron to Holy Church, and perpetuate the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to all Poſterity, by the utter extirpation of Hereſie:</q> It is remarkable, that as ſoon as ever it was publickly declared the Queen was with Child, the Iriſh throughout the Nation, were ſo confident that it would be a Son, that they offered to lay 20 Guinies to one of it; which the Engliſh were very ſenſible they would never have ventured, had they not been acquainted with the Myſtery of it. And now they expreſs their Rejoycing with Bonfires, Bagpipes, Drinking and Revelling for ſeveral Nights together, forcing the Engliſh to come out of their Beds, and to drink the King and Princes good Health, with Confuſion to their Enemies upon their Knees; which they well underſtood were the Proteſtants: and ſuch as would not comply, were called Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Oliverian Dogs, and they hardly refrain'd from Murthering them; and the Officers of Chriſt-Church, were committed to the Stocks; becauſe Tyrconnel fancyed that the Bells did not Ring mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enough on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture ſays; <hi>The Joy of the Wicked is ſhort,</hi> and ſo theirs proved; for a while after a Ship came from Amſterdam to Dublin, with Letters from a Friend of Tyrconnels, to acquaint him, that he did imagine the Prince of Orange had a Deſign againſt England, ſince none in Holland could gueſs what elſe the great and haſty preparations made there ſhould mean; Tyrconnel ſent this Letter to the Secretary of State, who ſhewed it the King; but they made no other uſe of it, than to Scorn and Redicule his Intelligence, as the Secretary did in a Letter ſent back to him: But freſh Suſpicions daily aroſe, and the matter ſeemed ſtill more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57819:55"/>whereupon the huffing Iriſh, called the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Rebels, ſaying; they were ſure they would joyn with the Prince, and as certain that they would be beaten, and be ſerved the ſame ſauce as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth was; and Bloodily and Maliciouſly expreſt themſelves againſt the Prince, whoſe Head they threatned to ſtick on a Pole, and carry it round the Kingdom; and after K. James Proclamation came to them, L. C. Juſtice Nugent that Confident Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Iriſhman in his Charge to the Jury among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vilifying Reproaches upon the <hi>P.</hi> of Orange, Audaciouſly and Impudently added; <q>that now the States of Holland were weary of their Prince, they had ſent him over to be dreſt as Monmouth was; but that was too good for him, and that he doubted not before a Month paſſed,</q> to hear that they were hung up all over England in Bunches, like Ropes of Onions.</p>
            <p>At this time of his preſent Majeſties Deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, the Popiſh Army in Ireland were about 8000, whereof near half were ſent into England to aſſiſt K. James, and the other were diſperſed up and down the Kingdom; being but an handful in compariſon of the Proteſtants, who had Arms e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Dublin alone, to have Maſtered them; and it was propoſed by ſome, (when they heard the King had ſent Commiſſioners to Treat with his Highneſs the Prince of Orange) to Seize the Caſtle of Dublin with the Stores and Ammunition which had been very Feaſible by ſecuring Tyrconnel, who had only 600 Men to guard him; and they by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Expreſſes from England, of the wonderful Progreſs of the Princes Forces, were ſo generally Diſcouraged, that they declared themſelves deſirous to lay down their Arms, propoſing to themſelves, only to remain in the ſame condition they were in K. Charles II. time, and Tyrconnel himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57819:56"/>the Proteſtants to ſignifie the ſame to their Friends in England, that he was willing to part with the Sword upon thoſe Terms, with K. James his leave; For though he received the firſt News of the Princes Landing with the greateſt Diſdain and Contempt, Boaſting, that he was able to raiſe an Army of an Hundred Thouſand Men, on a Months notice, and gave Commiſſions to every one that would accept of them, yet the additional Accounts of his Highneſſes daily Succeſs raiſed ſuch a Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, that by all his Actions, it did ſufficiently appear he had no thoughts of ſtanding out, and all his Diſcourſes expreſſed his Diſordered and ill Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the preſent Tendency of Affairs; which was much increaſed by the dreadful Alarm that the Proteſtants had from a Letter ſent to the Earl of Mount Alexander, giving him an account of an Horrible Maſſacre deſigned upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants on December 9. being Sunday; the Letter came to Dublin the Friday before, and the News thereof ſo Terrified the Proteſtants, that the next Day above 3000 got away into the Ships that were in the Harbor at that time; which were ſo cramm'd, that they were ready to be ſtifled, Deſerting their Houſes, and all that ever they had in the World, and running to the Ships with ſcarce Cloaths on their Backs, and went to the Iſle of Man in England, or the North of Ireland; ſuch ſtrange Confuſions and Diſtractions did the Dread of the Barbarous and cruel uſage which they feared from the Iriſh produce, many of them having been eye witneſſes of the Horrid Murders and Ravages committed by them in 1641.</p>
            <p>Tyrconnel having notice of this ſudden Hurry, on Sunday Morning ſent two Proteſtant Lords to perſwade the People not to go away, and ordered a Yatch to fetch back them that were gone; but both
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57819:56"/>proved ineffectual: He then ſent to ſome of the Principal Proteſtants in Dublin, aſſuring them with many Oaths and Proteſtations; that he had an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Abhorrence of any ſuch Deſign as Maſſacring the Proteſtants, and beg'd them to perſwade their their Friends not to remove: The dreadful Tydings Arrived at other places in Ireland, that very Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Morning, while the People were at Church and ſtruck them with ſuch Horror and Amazement, for fear of preſent Deſtruction, that many for haſt got out of the Windows, others were ready to be ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to Death at the Doors, many left their Hats and Periwigs behind them; yea, the Cloaths on their Backs were torn to pieces in the Crowd, others were trampled under Foot, and the Women in worſe condition then the Men: Nay, for ſeveral Sundays after the Proteſtants carried Arms with them to Church, the Miniſter himſelf being Armed while Preaching; whether the Deſign was real or no, or whether this Diſcovery prevented it, is not known; but certainly the dread of it produced the greateſt Horror, Grief and Deſpair that Humane Nature could be capable of.</p>
            <p>In this Conſternation things continued till Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, when advice coming of K. James his flying to France, the Iriſh Lords moved Tyrconnel to deliver up the Sword, which many thought he would have been eaſily perſwaded to, ſince at the beginning of the Alarm, it was believed that he would be the firſt Man in the Government, who would endeavour his eſcaping, having already packt up moſt of his Goods of Value, and ſhipt ſome of his Treaſure: His whole Council were of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he ſhould ſurrender, and he finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo very weak, and ſo much in the power of the Proteſtants, proteſted to them with the deepeſt Oaths and Curſes, according to his uſual Acts of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57819:57"/>Diſſimulation, Falſhood and Flattery; <q>That he would be rid of the Government very willingly, ſo as it might be with Honour; that it was eaſy for him to ruine and deſtroy the Kingdom; and make it not worth a Groat, but impoſſible to preſerve it for his Maſter: At another time he told them; that he could not deliver the Sword with Honour, till it was demanded; and askt them, whether they would have him throw it over the Caſtle Wall;</q> for there was none to take it: Some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he intended in earneſt, to have parted with it, eſpecially if it had been demanded before K. James went into France; having likewiſe before procured Letters to be ſent to England, to excuſe the Male Adminiſtrations in the Government; <q>and that it was the Opinion of all the Catholicks, that the Kingdom would be ruined and themſelves alſo, if they yielded not to the Prince of Orange; that they would be contented to be reduced to the ſame State they were in, when King James came to the Crown &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, the generality of the Proteſtants were of Opinion, that he meant nothing leſs, only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to gain time, and delude them till he had got a kind of an Army together to maſter them; and they were confirmed therein by his Secret giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out 500 Commiſſions of one ſort and another, in a Day: The Iriſh likewiſe aſſembled in great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and and were called Rapparees, Armed with Skeins and Half-Pikes, killing the Cattle of the Engliſh, and ſtealing an 100 or 2 at once in a Night, ſo that many Subſtantial Proteſtants, who owned ſeveral Hundreds of black Cattel and Sheep, &amp;c. had not one left; and for 40 Miles together in the Province of Munſter, the Iriſh Cabbins were full of Beef, ſtoln from the Engliſh; which they did not ſo much as beſtow ſalt upon, but hung it up in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57819:57"/>Smoak, ſo that it lookt and ſtunk as bad as Carrion; It was affirmed, that in 9 Days, the Iriſh ſtole ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand Cattel in that one Province, and at length to compleat the miſeries of the Proteſtants, they Robbed and Pillaged their Houſes, ſo that thoſe who had lived in great Hoſpitality and Plenty, now wanted Bread to eat, and had nothing left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from Starving.</p>
            <p>All this while the New Levies were Muſtering eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day, the Prieſts putting off their Wolves Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and with their Swords and Periwigs turn'd Commanders, and Exerciſed the Iriſh Soldiers: All the Scum and Raſcality of the Country, were made Officers, every where Papiſts inliſted themſelves, and the Prieſts ſuffered no Man to come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57819:58"/>one of their own Juſtices, who in his Charge at the Quarter-Seſſions, declared, <q>That among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conveniences which they received from this Government,</q> one was, <q>That it had rid them of Tories, for all theſe were taken into the Kings Army.</q>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57819:59"/>France; which more Exaſperated the Proteſtants againſt K. James as a Violator of Publick Faith to his Subjects, and likewiſe ruined the little Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his Lord Deputy had among them.</p>
            <p>Soon after a French Engineer Landed at Cork, and came with all Expedition to Dublin, aſſuring Tyrconnel that K.

            <p>About this time, Collonel Hamilton is ſent with an Army to the North of Ireland, and though more early in the year than uſual, yet the Judges were ſent into the Country, on pretence to puniſh the Thieves and Robbers that plundred the Proteſtants; but the Deſign was to Condemn thoſe poor Proteſtants, that had taken up Arms and Defended their Houſes againſt them, and likewiſe to raiſe Mony for the Army, their being very little in the Exchequer; And the Judges read a Letter in every County, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected from the Government to the principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and to the Miniſter and Popiſh Prieſt of every Pariſh, requiring them to Summon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners together, and perſwade them to Subſcribe to the utmoſt of their Ability, for the Subſiſtance of the Kings Forces, aſſuring them, that he would be ſoon at the Head of them with a confiderable Aſſiſtance from France; and that they who had no Mony, ſhould ſend in Meal, Malt, Beef, Cheeſe, Butter, Herrings, or elſe Leather Brogs, Stockins, Wool Cloth, Linnen or any other Goods the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try afforded: This was a great Oppreſſion to the Proteſtants, who though they had but very little left by the Rabble; yet muſt Contribute largely, or elſe were reckoned well-wiſhers to the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>The Lord Galmoy was likewiſe ſent with Forces to Guard the paſſages between the North of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and thoſe parts of Munſter and Connaught
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57819:60"/>that adjoyned to Ulſter, to prevent the South and Weſtern Proteſtants from joyning, who being a Malicious and Bloody Papiſt firſt drew Blood there, cauſing two Gentlemen who had taken Arms for their own Defence under Collonel Sandaſon, to be Hanged on a Sign-poſt at Belniot, and their Heads being cut off, were kickt about the Streets by his Soldiers like Foot-balls; at Ornagh he took 2 others upon the ſame pretence, and cauſed the Son firſt to Hang his Father, and carry his Head on a pole through the Streets, crying, this is the Head of a Traytor; and then the young Man himſelf was Hanged: It was alſo Reported, that ſome of his Dragoons meeting with a Clergymans Wife, whoſe Husband had fled Northward, ſeveral of them one after another Raviſhed her, and then ript up her Belly, and expoſed her with a dead Man upon her: At Tipperary, an Engliſh Gentleman ſeeing ſome Dragoons marching towards his Houſe, ſhut up his Doors, (it being late in the Evening) as if they were gone to Bed; but 16 of them coming thither, and not being quickly admitted, they forced open his Doors, calling him Traytor for ſhutting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Forces; and having pillaged all things of value, they then deflowred his Daughter, and only Child before his Face; all 16 lay with her, and 3 of them (as was affirmed by his Family) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was actually dead.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57819:60"/>and obtain better Terms from them: But at length March 12. 1689. he Landed at Kingſale, at which the Proteſtants and ſome Papiſts, ſeemed not very well ſatisfied, nay the firſt were ſo indifferent, that for a Fortnight after he Arrived, they would not believe it; becauſe they imagined he had no great kindneſs for them, however they thought he would have made their condition more eaſie for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſpoke them fair, conſidering that the Iriſh depended upon many Friends which they boaſted they had in Scotland and England: But K.

James, thinking that he would begin with an Act of Mercy, and give him his Life; but on the contrary, he left him to the Law, whereby he was ſure to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and accordingly was Hanged and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; from hence K. James took his Journey to Dublin, where he was received with all Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Joy imaginable by Tyrconnel and the Popiſh Party, who lookt upon him as their only
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57819:61"/>Support, Champion and Deliverer: He was no ſooner Arrived, but the Iriſh diſcovered what his future Deſigns were in their common talk at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Houſes, declaring openly, <q>That the King would have ſuch a Powerful Army of French, Iriſh and Scots Roman-Catholicks, as ſhould force the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh into Obedience: That he did not think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into England by the means of any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Friends; but by a French power: So that when he came to his Throne, he might Rule as he thought fit; that the Proteſtants of Ireland, might feed themſelves with what hopes they pleaſed; but they ſhould quickly find the K. would neither va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue nor regard them. That the K. had a long time Careſſed the Damn'd Church of England (as they called it) and that he could do no good with them; but now he would do his Buſineſs without them, and ſo find an opportunity of ſhaking them quite off; that they did not doubt but to be in the midſt of England by Midſummer, and make that the Seat of War, thereby preſerving their own Country, Eſtates, and Tenants, and living on the Churls, (as they called the Engliſh), who they ſaid were Rich, and a giddy inconſtant People, not being ſatisfied with any kind of Government, and would, they doubted not, be ſoon divided, and broken among themſelves, ſo that they did not fear carrying their Point.</q>
            </p>
            <p>King James himſelf by his Diſcourſes and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſoon confirmed the ſame; For he had but 2 Conſiderable Proteſtants in his Army, Sir Thomas Newcomer and Collonel Ruſſell, theſe he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Disbanded, without any other Objection but their Religion; and declared to Collonel Sarsfield, who deſired Commiſſions for 2 of his Proteſtant Relations, and offered to be bound for their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>That he would Truſt no Proteſtant;</hi> and was heard

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57819:62"/>a Prince was to the rude Soldiers to Treat the poor Proteſtants, not only in the Country, but even in Dublin, under the very eye of the Government, in a Barbarous manner: It was ordinary with them to take the meat that the poor people had provided for their Families, without thanks or payment; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>K. James before his Arrival in Ireland, had Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57819:62"/>immediately to call a Popiſh Parliament there, to deſtroy the Act of Settlement, and reſtore the Iriſh Rebels to their Eſtates; which he was ſo impatient in, that he iſſued out Writs for them to Sit May 7. 1689 at Dublin, though it ſeem'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt his Intereſt at this time; and many of his own Party redicul'd him and his Councils, to call a Parliament to ſpend their time in wrangling about ſetling the Kingdom, and diſpoſing Eſtates before it was reduced to the Kings Obedience: But hereby it pleaſed God to infatuate them; for had they applyed themſelves to the Seige of London-Derry, it is to be feared, that Town and others in the North, had been taken before the Succors came, and then all Ireland had been their own; which might have been of very fatal Conſequence.</p>
            <p>For the Proteſtants upon the Orders that were iſſued through all parts of the Kingdom, to take away their Arms and Serviceable Horſes, concluded that an Engliſh Army was either Landed in ſome part of the Kingdom, or that the Government ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected one; which ſo incouraged the Proteſtants, that in many places they betook themſelves into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and ſtrong Holds, thinking that if they could defend themſelves from flying Parties and the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Iriſh Army would be ſo imploy'd by the Forces of England, that there could be no formal Seiges laid againſt them; and they ſhould ſecure themſelves with their Horſes and Arms, till they might find an opportunity of joyning with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Army: But theſe poor Men ſoon after found their miſtake, and thereupon were forced to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon tolerable Conditions, had they been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: but the Iriſh inſtead of performing them, ſent them to Jayl.

This vile Treachery and Severe Uſage, incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Proteſtants in the North, who were poſſeſt of London Derry, Inniskilling, and ſome other places to defend themſelves againſt the utmoſt Efforts of the Enemy: For Tyrconnel, as we have heard, having Armed a Rabble of 40 or 50 Thouſand Iriſh Papiſts, to live upon the Country without pay, from whence enſued miſerable Depredations, open and Noon-day Robberies, and an inevitable and ſudden Ruine of the Brittiſh and Proteſtant intereſt in Ireland; The Proteſtants of the North, though themſelves no longer under obligation to be Active in their own Deſtruction; but took up Arms in Defence of their Laws, againſt thoſe who Acted in Contradiction to all Laws; and from whom they had reaſon to fear all kind of Cruelty and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</p>
            <p>It hapned that the L. Tyrconnell, having Orders to Tranſport 3 or 4000 of his Iriſh Souldiers to England to Aſſiſt K. James, he took a particular care to ſend away the whole Regiment, quartered in and about London-Derry; but ſoon ſaw his Error, and endeavoured to repair it, by Commanding the Earl of Antrim to quarter there with his Regiment, who appeared before the Town without the Kings Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or any Officers of Note, or the leaſt warning of their coming; and having no other Arms but Skeans, Clubs, and ſuch other Weapons as Reams and Tories uſes, and this happening about the very time that the Proteſtants were Alarm'd with the Letter ſent to the Lord Mount Alexander, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſigned Maſſacre, the People of the Town were ſo Affrighted, that they refuſed them Entrance into the City, and conſulted their own ſafety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding to ſhut their Gates: One of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were already in view of the Town, and two of the Officers in it; but the younger ſort got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57819:63"/>and with their Swords drawn ran to the main Guards; Seized the Key, drew up the Bridge, and lockt the Ferry-Gate, though the Iriſh Soldiers were advanced within 60 yards of it; from thence they went to ſecure the other 3 Gates, and having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Guards at each of them, met in the Market: So happily did theſe Reſolute Youths Nick the very Minute of their Deſign, and upon ſuch a ſeemingly Raſh and Deſperate Action, did the preſervation of that important place, and conſequently in ſome meaſure, the whole Kingdom, out of the Hands of the Iriſh depend.</p>
            <p>The Alarum of the Deſigned Maſſacre, and Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connels Arming ſuch a Numerous Swarm of Iriſh Highlanders, had the like effect upon the Proteſtants of Inniskilling; and knowing this was the only place of Conſequence upon Lough Earne, which had held out with Remarkable Courage againſt the Iriſh Rebels in 1641. and which if they were now poſſeſt of, would give them an open Paſſage from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught to Ulſter, they therefore reſolve not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the 2 Companies of Iriſh Papiſts, which were ordered thither to quarter in the Town; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſpatcht Letters to all the Proteſtant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen thereabout, for their Advice and Aſſiſtance in that juncture; not judging themſelves able to keep out the 2 Foot Companies, they being but 80 Dwellers in all, and few or no Arms amongſt them; The Meſſengers returned with very little Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. moſt of the Engliſh diſſwading them from the Enterprize as dangerous, the Iriſh being well provided of Arms, Ammunition, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whereas they had not 10 pound of pouder, nor 20 well fixed Fire Arms in the Town: But the Reſolution of the People, Surmounted all theſe Difficulties, reſolving to run all Hazards, rather than expoſe their Lives to the Mercy of their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57819:64"/>and Bloody principled Enemies: The Iriſh Army approaching them within 18 Miles, they made freſh Inſtances to their Neighbours to come to their Aid, promiſing that whilſt they ſtaid with them, they ſhould have free quarter for Man and Horſe; whereupon ſeveral Proteſtants came into the Town, with their beſt Horſes and Arms, promiſing to ſtand by them in Defence of their Lives, and the Proteſtant Religion; which they did believe by the Preparations they heard were making by the Enemy, would be very, ſoon invaded; and the News they heard from London Derry, did much Fortifie their Courage: So that upon the Approach of the Iriſh Companies, the Inniskillin Horſe and Foot Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced toward them; but came no ſooner in View, ere the 2 Companies with the whole Rabble that was with them, turned their Backs and fled, without halting, in very great Fear and Diſorder; and their Officers being then at Dinner at a Gentlemans Houſe not far from thence, hearing the Inniskillin Men were come out, left their Dinners before they had half done, and ran away after them, and all of them got the next Day 24 Miles off, in great Terror of the Inniskilliners, who afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many admirable Actions againſt the Iriſh.</p>
            <p>King James's pretended Parliament Sate in Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, from May 7. 1689. to July 20. following, and in that ſhort time, entirely deſtroyed the Settlement of Ireland, and outed both the Proteſtant Clergy and Laity of their Free-Holds and Inheritances, by Repealing the 2 Acts of Settlement: <q>Whereby 2 thirds of the Proteſtants of the Kingdom held their Eſtates: And the Real Eſtates of all that dwelt or ſtaid in any place in the 3 Kingdoms, who did not own K.

They likewiſe paſſed an Act of Attainder, whereby above 3000 Proteſtants were Attainted, and their Eſtates forfeited to the King, ſome for being in Arms; but the greateſt part for abſenting themſelves, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings were thought very ſevere by the Proteſtants, ſince thoſe that Armed themſelves, did not Attempt any thing, even againſt thoſe whom the Lord Deputy, againſt the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Intereſt of the Nation, had intruſted with Arms and Imployments, except in their own Defence, when Invaded and Aſſaulted by them: Neither was there one Act of Hoſtility committed, wherein the Proteſtants were not on the Defenſive: Their Crime then if any, was only that they were unwilling to be Robb'd and Plundered, as their Neighbours were without oppoſition; but Diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of thoſe who under Colour of being King James's Soldiers, deſtroyed the Country; this was all the Reaſon: Tyrconnel had to proclaim them Rebels, for Killing and Murdering his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and with pillaging the Country; whereas it was Notorious, they never kil'd any but whom they found actually Robbing, for killing of whom the Laws of the Kingdom not only indemnified them; but likewiſe aſſigned them a Reward, and it is as plain, that the Proteſtants preſerved the Country
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57819:65"/>from being pillaged; and for this they now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Eſtates: As for thoſe that were abſent, it would have been unwiſely done for the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that were gone to England, to have returned again to a Ruinous Kingdom the Actual Seat of War, where all the goods they had left behind, were Imbezeled by Robbers; and their Eſtates given to thoſe Sons of Rebellion in 1641. And when Men of the beſt Eſtates in Ireland, wiſht themſelves away; and many were content to leave all and venture their Lives in little Boats, to the Mercy of the Seas in the death of Winter, reckoning any thing ſafer and eaſier, than to ſtay under a Government which had effectually deſtroy'd all the meaſures of Right and Wrong; and Condenmed ſo many Gentlemen to the loſs of all without allowing them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour either of being Tryed or Heard: And of thoſe that ſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>King James now ſets forward with his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward London Derry; where the Garriſon had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Proclaimed King William and Queen Mary, and had received from England 480 Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Arms for 2000 Men, with a Commiſſion to Collonel Lundy to be Governor, and promiſe of further Supply: King James's Army conſiſted in about 12000 Men, and a very good Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; his Generals were Monſieur de Mornont, General of the French Horſe, the Sieur Piſcina, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Foot; Collonel Hamilton Lieutenant General of the Iriſh Foot, all under the Standard of France; and conſiſting of ſeveral Regiments, commanded by the D, of Berwick, and Fitz-James his Brother, the Lord Nettervile Abercorn, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Shelden, and Collonel Randleigh: The King had ſome aſſurance given him, that the Town upon his Approach, would undoubtedly Surrender, and that the very ſight of ſo formidable an Army, would fright them into a Compliance, and therefore April. 18. he advances with his Army before the Walls with flying Colours: Orders were given that none ſhould fire, till the Kings Demands were firſt known; but the People of London-Derry, wondring to ſee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57819:66"/>Lieutenant General Hamilton approaching the Walls contrary to his ingagement, not to come within 4 Miles of the Town, imagined they were betrayed, and fired their Guns upon them; which being unexpected by the Enemy, ſome of them fled, others hid themſelves, and a great many were kill'd; and it was reported that one Captain Froy was ſlain near the Kings Perſon, who was in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order to find himſelf ſo Roughly and Unmannerly Treated by thoſe, from whom he expected a Dutiful Compliance, as well as at the Behaviour of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo different from the Character he had received of both; and therefore thoſe in the Town, who had incouraged him to try this dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, ſent ſome Perſons to the King to excuſe it, by alledging the Difficulty of Commanding an untractable Multitude. But upon their return, they were three Days before this, kept out by the People; Collonel Cunningham and Richards came into the Lough from England, with 2 Regiments and other Neceſſaries for Supply of Derry, with Inſtructions to receive Orders from Governor Lundy, who thereupon called a Council of War, where the 2 Collenels being preſent, with others unacquainted with the Condition of the Town, or the Inclination or Reſolution of the People they make an Order, <q>that there not being Proviſion in the Town for the preſent Garriſon and the 2 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, for above a week or ten Days; and the place not being Tenable againſt a Formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, therefore it was not Adviſable to Land the 2 Regiments, and that conſidering the Enemy will ſoon poſſeſs themſelves of the place, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers ſhall privately withdraw, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by a timely Capitulation, may make the better Terms with the Enemy: In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this Order,</q> Collonel Cunningham,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57819:66"/>Richards, with their Officers, went to their Ships; which with 2 Regiments on Board, Sailed Back for England: And the Council in purſuance of theſe pernicious intentions, proceeded to conclude upon a Surrender, and drew up a Paper to that purpoſe, which moſt of them Signed; and the Town was Deſigned to have been delivered up in 2 or 3 Days</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Officers and Soldiers in London-Derry, who knew nothing of the Order of Council, earneſtly intreated Collonel Lundy, that the Engliſh Forces might Land, that with their Aſſiſtance, they might take the Field, and fight the Enemy before the Cannon were brought over, in Order to the Preſervation of that Corner, into which the Proviſions and Wealth of 3 or 4 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was crouded: The Collonel to delude them, told them publickly, <q>That it was reſolved, the Engliſh Forces ſhould immedately Land, and when they were in their Quarters, the Gates ſhould be opened, and all joyn in Defence of the Town; and to carry on the Intreague, the Sheriffs were ordered to go through the City,</q> to provide quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for them; but all this was a meer ſham that he and the Officers might get away with the greater Eaſe and Safety.</p>
            <p>A Farty of Iriſh having a few Days before At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to Ford the River at Caſtle Fin, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by ſome Forces ſent out of Derry, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their coming over, till all their Ammunition was ſpent; After which, they followed the reſt of the Engliſh Army, which were 10000 ſtrong, and made good their Retreat to Derry; but were much Surprized to find the Gates ſhut againſt them by the Governors Order: So that many Officers Soldiers, and Private Gentlemen, were forced that Night to lye about the Walls; but the next Day with much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and ſome Violence upon the Centry by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57819:67"/>at him, and calling for Fire to burn the Gates, that and the other Gates were thrown open: This and other Paſſages, occaſioned great jealouſies of the Governor; but when the Town-Clerk found it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Publiſh the Reſolutions of the Council of War, <q>That Collonel Cunningham, his Ships, Men and Proviſions, ſhould return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all Gentlemen and others in Arms, ſhould quit the Garriſon,</q> and go along with him; the Common Soldiers were extreamly inraged at their Officers, ſeveral of whom at this time had Deſerted them and fled for England: So that they could not forbear expreſſing it with Violence on ſome of them; One Captain Bell was ſhot Dead, and another Burnt, who with more Officers was got into a Boat, as they imagined to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>K. James upon the Repulſe he had received, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame Evening with his Army to St. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtown, about 5 Miles from Derry; and ſtaid there 2 Days to wait for an Anſwer from the City, to the Propoſal he had made April 17. <q>That to prevent the effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, if they would Surrender the City, Honourable Terms ſhould be allowed them;</q> the Council in the abſence of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Lundy (who thought it for his ſafety to keep his Chamber) proceeded upon the Governors Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to chuſe 20 Men to go out and Capitulate with K. James; but the Multitude on the Walls, and at the Gates hearing of it, were ſo exceedingly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they Threatn'd: <q>If a Man of them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go out on that Errand, they would Treat him as a betrayer of the Town, the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and K. Williams Intereſt:</q> Upon which, none of them durſt offer to go, ond ſo a ſtop was put to that dangerous Capitulation, notwithſtanding the Orders of the Governor and Council; ſo little did
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57819:67"/>the Soldiers regard any Command that ſeemed to croſs their Reſolutions of Defending the City. The Multitude having thus broken the Authority of the Council, they with Collonel Lundy, thought fit to withdraw, &amp; he with ſome Difficulty got to the Ships at Culmore &amp; from thence to England: Upon which, the Garriſon ſeeing they were Deſerted by their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; and having reſolved to Defend the Town againſt the Enemy, they choſe Mr. Walker a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, and Major Baker to be their Governors du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege; and the Soldiers whom their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had left, choſe their Captains, and each Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which of the Collonels he would ſerve under, as they pleaſed themſelves; and one Mr. Bennet was ſent to England, to give an account of their Reſolutions to maintain the place; and to deſire Speedy Succors to be ſent from thence for their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>April 9. A Trumpet came to the Walls from K. James, to know why they ſent not out Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to Treat according to their Propoſals, but the People having put a ſtop to it, Collonel Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney wrote a few Lines to excuſe themſelves to the King: The next Day the Lord Straband came up, making many Propoſals; and offering his Kings Pardon, Protection, and Favour, if they would Surrender the Town; but theſe fine words, had no place with the Garriſon; for at that very time of this Capitulating, the Enemy were obſerved to uſe that opportunity, for drawing their Cannon to a convenient ſtand: Whereupon they deſired his Lordſhip to withdraw, or elſe they ſhould fire upon him; he ſtill continued his Compliments, till they plainly told him, they would never deliver the Town to any but K. William and Q Mary, and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: My Lord having ended all his Inſinuations, found himſelf at laſt obliged to Retire; So that K.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57819:68"/>James having loft all hopes of Accomodation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved if poſſible, to reduce them by force, and raiſed ſeveral Batteries againſt the Town, his Head Quarters being ſtill at St. Johnſtown: The Fort of Culmore had ſome time before been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Captain Jemmat the Governor, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Collonel Lundy, and a few Iriſh poſſeſt themſelves of it; but it was ſoon Recovered by a ſmall Artifice: Divers Skirmiſhes happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 2 Armies during the Siege, particularly May 6. in a Sally made by the Beſiegers, wherein 200 of the Enemy were killed, and 500 wounded, 300 of whom dyed in a few days of their wounds; and among others, General Mommune a French Man, with other Officers of Note.</p>
            <p>The Enemy now remove their Main Body, from St. Johnſtown, and pitch their Tents about 2 Miles from Derry, on an Hill, placing ſuch ſtrict Guards on all ſides of the Town, that the Beſieged found it impoſſible to Convey or Receive any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and difficult to come by the Wells of water; which they often ſought for, and coſt ſome of them their Blood. June 4. The Enemy with a Body of Horſe and Foot, made an Attack on the Windmill Works; beginning with a loud Huzza, which was ſeconded from all parts of of the Camp, with moſt dreadful Screicks and Howlings of a Numerous Rabble that attended their Army: The Faggot Men were forced to quit their New Defence; which they laid before them for Security againſt the Shot, and run for it; Captain Butler with 30 Horſe, mounted the Works; but none of his Men falling, though ſhot at, the Beſieged found they had Armour, and therefore kill'd their Horſes, whereby only 3 Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers eſcapt: The Iriſh Foot did not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo faſt as uſual, which was wondred at, till it was obſerved, that in their Retreat, they took the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57819:68"/>Dead on their Backs, to ſecure themſelves from the Shot; which was more ſecure than when they were alive: the Enemy in this Action, loſt 400 Men, moſt of their Officers kill'd, and ſome made Priſoners, the Befieged had only ſix Souldiers and a Captain kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>June 15. A Fleet of 30 Sail came into the Lough from England; but to prevent their coming up to the Town, the Enemy Contrived a Boom of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber joyned with Iron Chains, and a Cable of 12 Inches, and afterward another, of which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged had an account by ſome Priſoners taken, which very much diſcouraged them, for they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the Fleet (at the firſt fight, of which they were very joyful) would be able to get up with the Proviſions which they ſo extreamly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſomuch that the Men where they could find an Horſe a Grazing neer the Windmill, would kill and eat him: The Enemy upon the appearing of the Ships, ſeemed to be in a mighty Conſternation, pulling down their Tents, and the Soldiers chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their red Coats, ran away; but the Terror was ſoon over, when they ſaw them make no great Attempt to come up, though they had both Wind and Tyde to aſſiſt them; and thereupon they raiſed Batteries to hinder them, and made the Boom afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
            <p>June 24. Roſen the French Marſhal General, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Camp; and finding ſo little progreſs in the Siege, he Swore by the Belly of God, he would Demoliſh the Town, and bury the Beſieged in the Aſhes; and put all to the Sword without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Age or Sex, and Study the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torments, to lengthen out the miſery of thoſe that oppoſed his Command; but providence diſappointed his Cruel Malice, and delivered the poor Proteſtants out of his bloody Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57819:69"/>
The Beſieged uſed all poſſible endeavours, to get intelligence from the Ships, by making many ſigns from the Steeple, by Cannon Shot, and by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Flag, to repreſent their Diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to them; but all proved ineffectual: At length June 25 One Roch, who got to the Water ſide over againſt them, and then Swam croſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, came and gave them an account of the Ships Men, Proviſion and Arms in them for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, adding, That it was deſired, that if he got ſafe to Town, to give them in the Ships notice of it by 4 Guns from the Steeple; which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done: They endeavoured to ſend back to M. Gen. Kirk, and one went to that purpoſe; but was taken and hanged by the Enemy: The Beſieged were more ſtreightned every day by the Enemy, their Iron Balls being now ſpent; ſo that they were obliged to make Balls of Brick, covered over with lead. June 30. The L. Clancarty at the Head of a Regiment, poſſeſſes himſelf of a Line, and enters ſome Miners in a low Cellar; but the Beſieged fired ſo briskly upon them, that his Lordſhip was forced to quit his Poſt; and leave his Miners, and 100 of his beſt Men dead on the place, which much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Iriſh, who had a Prophecy among them, that a Clancarty ſhould knock at the Gates of Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but we ſee that little value is to be put either upon Iriſh Prophecies or Courage.</p>
            <p>The ſame day Governor Baker dyed, which was a ſenſible loſs to the Garriſon, and generally lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being a valiant Perſon, who in all his Actions, ſhewed the greateſt Honour, Courage and Conduct. And now Roſen ſends a Letter into the Town, that <q>if they did not Surrender by 6 a Clock Afternoon, July 1. he would Order all the Proteſtants in the adjacent Towns, to be driven under the Walls of Derry, where they ſhould periſh, if not Relieved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57819:69"/>by the Beſieged, that he would deſtroy all the Country, if any Troops came to their Relief: But if the Garriſon would become Royaliſſs (as he termed it) and deliver on any Tolerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he would protect them from all injuries, and give them his Favour:</q> The Beſieged received all theſe Propoſals with Contempt, and ſome Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, having before made an Order; That it ſhould be Death to mention a Surrender; the Enemy drive the poor Proteſtants, according to their Threatning under the Walls; and the Beſieged thinking them Enemies, fired on them, but were mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hear that Divine providence had ſpared them; and that their ſhot had kill'd 3 of the Enemy; There were ſome thouſands of them which ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Beſieged, that in ſight of their Camp, they erected a Gallows, threatning to hang their Friends that were Priſoners, unleſs they were removed and ſent home again: The Priſoners themſelves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Iriſh, declaring they could not blame the Beſieged for putting them to Death, ſeeing their People exerciſed ſuch Severity and Cruelty upon the poor Proteſtants that were under protection: The ſight of the Gallows, and the importunity of ſome Friends of thoſe that were to ſuffer, at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, ſo that July 4 the poor People had leave to return home; the Enemy had now advanced ſo near the Town, that the Beſieged from the Works, could talk with the Iriſh, who expreſt great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice <q>and hatred againſt the French, curſing thoſe Damn'd Fellows that watched in Trunks (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Jack Boots) who had all Preferments in the Army that fell; and took the Bread out of their Mouths; and they believed would have all the Kingdom to themſelves at laſt.</q> July 11.

            <p>Neither were the Inniskillin Men wanting in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming many notable Actions; for during the whole time of the Siege, they kept at leaſt one half of the Iriſh Army from coming before London-Derry, for fear they ſhould relieve the Town; So that they durſt not make a Regular Attack upon the place; but were forced to divide their Men, keeping ſtrong Guards at ſeveral diſtant places, and therefore they deſerve no ſmall part of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that places Preſervation; and particularly the Remarkable Defeat given to the Iriſh the day before the Raiſing the Siege, (the News whereof

The Inniskilliners hearing that a Body of about 6000 Iriſh under Major General Mackarty, were Marching toward them, they very boldly and bravely went to meet them about 20 Miles off, at a place called Newtown Butler, where though the Enemy had ſecured their Army beyond a long Bog, yet the Courage of the Engliſh was ſo great, that they came up to the Mouths of their Cannon, and Seized them, killing all their Cannoneers, which ſo terrified the Iriſh, that both Horſe and Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fled; and the Engliſh Foot perſuing theirs, and giving quarter to ſew or none but Officers that day, they not having Courage to fight for their Lives, Deſperately leapt into the Bogg to ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the Number of about 500, and none eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped drowning, except one Perſon only, who got through after many a ſhot made after him: In this Action, a Remarkable ſtroke was given by Capt.

James had, unleſs thoſe before Derry; who were then much broken, and that he came with a Deſign to looſe his Life, and was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he had miſt of his End, being unwilling to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live that Day.</q> This was a moſt Remarkable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, obtained under the Command of the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Collonel Woolſey, the Iriſh were reckoned 5000 and the Engliſh not above 2000, the Enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that 3000 of their Men were wanting, they loſt 7 Cannon, 14 Barrels of Powder, a great quantity of Cannon and Muſquet Ball, and all their Drums and Colours; the Engliſh loft not above 20 Men, and 40 or 50 wounded; and hereby the Siege of Inniskillin was prevented, which by a Letter found about Mackarty, was deſigned to have been Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a few Days by this Party, who were to be joyned with another Detachment, under the D. or Berwick: It has been ſince publiſhed, that this great Defeat partly happened by a fatal miſtake in the Word of Command among the Iriſh; for the Inniskillin Men charged the Iriſh Right Wing very ſmartly, which Mackarty perceiving, Ordered ſome of his Men to face to the Right, and March to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Friends, the Officer that received the Orders miſtook; and Commanding the Men in ſtead of Facing to the Right, to Face to the Right about, and ſo March: The Iriſh in the Reer ſeeing their Front look with their Faces towards them and move, thought they had been Running; and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, threw down their Arms, and run away: The reſt ſeeing their Men run in the Reer,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57819:72"/>run after them for Company, and were moſt of them Cut off, or drowned in the Beggs and Loughs; ſo unhappy may a ſmall thing prove to a great Body of Men, and at other times, a little thing in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, proves very Advantagious: For we read of a Roman at Plough, who ſtood with his Ox-Yoak in in a Gap, and ſtopt the Soldiers that were running away, this made them face about and gain the Field; though all Men muſt acknowledge in that Action of the Inniskilliners, as well as at London-Derry, there was a great deal to be Attributed to their Valour; but more to the providence of God.</p>
            <p>Another Remarkable Paſſage is Related; That before the Fight, about an hour and half after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the People of Inniskillin ſaw from thence a great Light in the Air above Newtown Butler, where Mackarty then lay with his Army, which coutinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome hours, ſo that they concluded the Iriſh had ſet that Town and all the Country about on Fire, or raiſed ſome Fire in the Country to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Lieutenant General Sarsfield to joyn with them; but after the fight was over, upon inquiry into the matter, they found there was no fire that Night raiſed among them: This is the more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; becauſe the like was ſeen at Glaſlough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Action they had there with the Iriſh of the Garriſon of Charlemont, whom they Defcated March 13. before, killing their Leader, and about 200 of his Men. with the loſs only of one Captain; about a week before this happened, at 11 a Clock in a very dark Night, ſeveral Pillars of fire appeared in the Air, pointed from towards Charlemont, which were ſo light, they might have read by them, and continued thus 2 hours, to the Obſervation of all People there: The like account we have from Dr. Robert Maxwell, late Biſhop of Kilmore, of what
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57819:73"/>happened in the Rebellion of 1641. who relates that 56 Proteſtants Men, Women, and Children, were taken out of his Houſe and Drowned by the Iriſh at Curbridg, and that 3 or 4 Nights before, in the dark of the Moon, about one a Clock in the Night, a Light was obſerved in manner of a long Pillar to ſhine for a great way through the Air, and refracted upon the North Gabel of his Houſe; it gave ſo great a light about an hour together, that divers of the Watch Read both Letters and Books of a very ſmall Character thereby, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor believed, did preſage that Bloody Maſſacre which inſued. It is difficult to enter into the reaſon of theſe things; but this is only matter of Fact, and every Man is left to his own Conjectures in them.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions in Ireland, K. William gives out Commiſſions in England, to Raiſe 18 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, and 4 or 5 of Horſe, and the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies went on with ſuch ſpeed, that the greateſt part were Raiſed, Armed, and Clothed in 6 Weeks, and Auguſt 12. they were Imbarqued at High-Lake near Cheſter for Ireland; being about 10000 Foot and Horſe, and 3 Days after they Landed near Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus, incamping in the Fields that Night; the Garriſon Apprehending a Siege, burnt their Suburbs, and prepared for their Defence: Whereupon Duke Schomberg General of all their Majeſties Forces, ſent 5 Regiments to incamp before the Town, and more the next day, which Surrounded it; whereupon they deſired a Parley, and required time to ſend to K. James for Succors; which the General abſolutely refuſed, and with his Mortars and Cannon, played upon the Town: Four days after they beat another Parley deſiring to March out with their Drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. but this was denyed; During the Parley, the Duke viſited all the Trenches, and opſerwed the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57819:73"/>Walls of the Caſtle, and a poor Dutchman was ſhot from the Walls, making his returns to Reproaches againſt K. William, ſaying, That their King was a Tinker King, and had nothing but braſs Mony: He was not nimble enough at getting off, when the Parley was over, and ſo loſt his Life for his Jeſt's ſake; Aug. 25. The Guns play'd furiouſly, and made a great Breach in the Walls, which the Iriſh ſeeing, and fearing our Men would enter, they got a great number of Cattel together; and drove them all as near the top of the Breach, as they could force them to go, keeping themſelves cloſe behind them, ſeveral of the Cattel were killed by the ſhot, and as they fell, the Iriſh threw Earth, Stones and Wood upon them; but this they thought would not hold long, and ſo deſired a third Parley; and at length it was agreed, that they ſhould March out with their Arms, and ſome Baggage, which they did accordingly; and the Engliſh Forces took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Carickfergus, (as they had done before of the Towns of Belfaſt and Antrim, which the Enemy for fear had Deſerted:) While they were in Treaty at Carickfergus, and the Articles were ſcarce agreed to, Mackarty Moor, Governor of the Town, was got in the Dukes Kitchin in the Engliſh Camp; which his Grace ſmiled at, and did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to Dinner; Saying, <q>If he had ſtaid like a Soldier with his Men, he would have ſent to him; but if he would go and eat with Servants in a Kitchin,</q> let him be doing: The Country People were ſo Inveterate againſt the Soldiers, (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how they ſerved them ſome few days before) that they ſtript moſt part of the Women; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a great many. Arms from the Men, and took it very ill, that the Duke did not hang them all, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſtanding the Articles: Nay, they were ſo rude, that the Duke was obliged to ride in among them
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57819:74"/>with his Piſtol in his Hand, to keep the Iriſh from being Murdered; who were forced to fly to the Soldiers for Protection, ſo angry were they at one another, though they all live in the ſame Country; The Enemy had about 150 killed and wounded in the Siege; and the Engliſh as many killed and about 60 wounded.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Army now March on, through Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, Drummore, Lought, it land, and ſo to Newry; which they found newly burnt and Deſerted by the D. of Berwick and his Forces, who had only time to ſet it on fire, and take all the People, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was valuable along with him; upon which, the Duke ſent a Trumpet to the Iriſh, to let them know, <q>That if they burnt any more Towns, he would give them no Quarter;</q> Sep. 7. The Army Marched thence to Dundalk which was likewiſe Deſerted, but not burnt: Here they Incampt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Mile of the Town, in a low moiſt Ground where many grew ſickly; the Iriſh boaſting to the Proteſtants when they went away; <q>That they would drive the Engliſh all back again into the Sea, or elſe they would dye of themſelves, not being uſed to the Field, eſpecially in a ſtrange Country, and at that time of the year:</q> And indeed it went hard with them for want of Proviſions, eſpecially, Bread, of which the Enemy grew ſenſible: They had before Retreated beyond Droghedah, in much Conſternation, not doubting but the Duke being an Old General, would not have come into Ireland without a good Army, and all things well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and were upon the point of Deſerting not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Droghedah; but Dublin alſo, by the Advice of the French General Roſen, and to Retreat towards Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and Lymerick: But when De Roſen heard that D. Scomberg halted, he ſaid, he was ſure they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſomething; and therefore adviſed to haſten
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57819:74"/>their Army together, in which Tyrconnel was ſo diligent, that from 8000, he made a Body of 20000 Men in a few days, with which they Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to Ardee, and Seis'd all the Proviſions that the Proteſtants had got together, for the Engliſh Army, which they expected there; but unhappily ſtay'd too long: Sep. 13. The Engliſh received 204 Loads of Bread, which the Ships brought to Carlingford; and then the General Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Camp to be fortified, that the Enemy might not break in upon them, and ſtrict Guards to be kept in the Night, becauſe they had notice that the Iriſh Marched toward them, and accordingly Sep. 21. they advanced to the Engliſh Camp, and offered Battle; but the D. knowing they could not eaſily force the Camp, and for ſeveral other pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Reaſons declined to ingage; upon which the Iriſh drew off to Droghedah: About which time, a Correſpondence was diſcovered to be held with the Enemy by ſome Soldiers in the French Regiments upon which, 6 of the Principal Conſpirators were, Hanged, who all dyed Papiſts; and confeſt they lifted themſelves on purpoſe to bring over as many as they could to K. James, they prayed for K. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Queen Mary, and askt their pardons for their Treachery; and declared further, that if the General had ingaged the Enemy when they offered Battel, they themſelves were to put the Engliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into Confuſion, by firing in the Reer and ſo Deſerting; ſo that it was a great Providence that the Duke then refuſed to fight.</p>
            <p>Sep. 25. Collonel Lloyd with about 1000 Innis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killiners Defeated a Body of 5000 Iriſh that were going to Sligo, killing 700, and taking O Kelly, and 40 more Officers Priſoners, with a great Booty of about 8000 Cattel, with the loſs only of 14 Men; The News whereof coming to Duke Schomberg in the Camp, he ordered all the Inniskilling Horſe and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57819:75"/>Foot that had lately joyned the Army to draw out, and Complimented them ſo far, as to ride all along the Line with his Hat off, and then ordered ſome Fire-works to be made for joy. A great many now began to be ſick, by reaſon of the bad weather, and moſt were ſo lazy, that they would ſtarve, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fetch Fern, or any thing elſe to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dry and warm; which was the greateſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diſtempers, Sickneſs and Death it ſelf, and many when dead, were incredibly louſy; which cauſed the General to ſay, <q>the Engliſh Men will fight;</q> but they do not love to work: Both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Firing grew now very ſcarce, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the diſtempers among the Soldiers, upon which the Sick were ordered to be ſent Aboard the Ships at Dundall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that had brought freſh Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The beginning of November, the Enemy Decampt and Marcht to Winter Quarters; and at the ſame time, Sligo was taken by Sarsfield, who came upon them unexpectedly with a conſiderably Body, and the place not being provided either with Ammunition or Water, it was Surrendred to the Iriſh upon Honourable Terms: As the Engliſh Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came out of the Town, Collonel Sarsfield ſtood with a Purſe of Guineas, and offered to every one that would ſerve K. James, 5 Guineas Advance, with Horſe and Arms, but they all anſwered, <hi>they would never fight for the Papiſhes,</hi> as they called them; Nay, even thoſe that were a dying in the Camp, were wont to expreſs no other Sorrow, than <hi>Plague on theſe Papiſhes, that we muſt dye here, and not have leave to go and Fight them:</hi> The Sickneſs increaſed, and great numbers dyed daily; ſo that the General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to decamp from Dundalk, and March back to Belfaſt; which they did accordingly, the Sick being carryed in Waggons, and the Army Marcht in the We and Snow, ſo that many Periſht by the way, yet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57819:75"/>upon an Alarm that the Enemy were coming upon them, they grew very hearty and began to unbuckle their Tents, ſaying, If the Iriſh came, they ſhould pay for their lying in the Cold ſo long: As to the number of Men that dyed of this great Mortality, it is computed that near 1700 dyed about Dundalk, about 2000 were ſhipt for England, and not much above half came aſhoar; but dyed at Sea: So that in the whole, they loſt near 5000 Men, which was imputed very much to the bad Weather, the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the place, and the Tenderneſs and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the Engliſh, whereas the Dutch kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo clean and warm, that not above 11 of them dyed the whole Campaign.</p>
            <p>A Remarkable Paſſage happened a year before, near Dundalk, which ſeemed to preſage this great deſtruction of Men: A worthy Gentleman with 2 others and their Servants, coming from Dublin to the North, as they approached Dundalk about 9 at Night, eſpyed ſeveral little Trinkling Lights in the Air, with 2 larger then the reſt; about the ground where the Engliſh Army Incampt this year; and at the ſame time, they heard the moſt heavy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Groans in the World, which continued till they came to Newry; but the Lights they ſaw only upon the Plains of Dundalk.</p>
            <p>Nov. 23. The Enemy with a Detachment of 1600 Men, and 100 Voluntiers, Attempted to force the Paſs at Newry, and then deſigned to go along the Line, and deſtroy the Frontier Garriſons, there were not above 60 Engliſh in the Town, and not 40 of thoſe able to preſent a Muſquet, who yet fired upon them ſo briskly, and affrighted them with ſuch load Huzza's, that the Iriſh imagining their number far greater then they were, fled, leaving 6 Men dead, and carrying off 12 Horſload of dead and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Men. Dec. 4. Collonel Woolſely went in the

            <p>In March 400 Danes Landed at Belfaſt, with the P. of Wirtemburg their General, being luſty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, well Clothed and Armed.

That he during his time, had taken care that the Engliſh ſhould not have any great ſtrength by Sea; and now to Equip and ſet out a Fleet, would be tedious, beſides the Expences, and that he did not doubt but the French would maſter them.</q> As ſoon as theſe Forces Landed at Cork, above 500 of them dyed of ſome Peſtilent Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; the reſt being come to Dublin, General Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun ſent to the Governor Lutterel, to deliver the Keys of the City and Caſtle to him, purſuant to K.

            <p>April 12. Sir Cloveſly Shovel came to Belfaſt, as Convoy to ſeveral Ships that brought over neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Army; and having notice of a Frigat at Anchor in the Bay of Dublin, with other ſmall Veſſels Loaden with Hides, Tallow, Wooll, and ſome Plate, and other Goods deſigned for France, he Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither, and leaving the great Ships in the Bay, with the Monmouth Yatch, and 2 or 3 more, and ſeveral Long-Boats, he went to Polebeg, where the Frigat lay, of 16 Guns and 4 Pattereroes; being a Scotch Ship taken the year before in the Channel: When K. James heard of it, he ſaid; <hi>It was ſome of his Loyal Subjects of England, returning to their Duty and Allegiance:</hi> But when he ſaw them draw near the Ship, and heard the firing, he rid out towards Rings End, whither gathered, a vaſt Croud of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all ſorts, and ſeveral Regiments were drawn

James went back very much diſſatisfied, and it was reported, ſhould ſay, <hi>That all the Proteſtants in Ireland were of Cromwells Breed, and deſerved to have their Throats Cut;</hi> However all the Proteſtants that walked that way during the Action, were impriſoned, and 2 made their eſcape to the Boats.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57819:78"/>did 2 or 3 times, which Teague O Regan, the Old Iriſh Governor perceiving, he Swore, <hi>If they could not get out, they ſhould have no Entertainment nor Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within:</hi> And was as good as his word, for they were forced to make little Huts within the Paliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, ſo that between Teague and the Engliſh, the poor Fellows were in a lamentable Condition; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the General ſent ſeveral Regiments to block up Charlemont, with Cannon to force Old Teague out of his Neſt if poſſible, having Summoned him to Surrender ſome time before, who returned the Meſſenger with this Anſwer; Go tell thy Maſter <q>from Teague O Regan, that he's an Old Knave, and by St Patrick, he ſhall not have the Town at all;</q> when God knows there was no Town ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng, but an Old Caſtle: The Duke only ſmiled and ſaid. <hi>He would give Teague greater Reaſon to be angry in a ſhort time,</hi> and accordingly thoſe Iriſh that had a mind to go out, being kept in, ſoon made Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als very ſcarce, and no hopes of Relief appearing, the Old Governor ſent to Treat about a Surrender, and the Terms being ſoon agreed to, this ſtrong place was delivered up, about 400 Men, and 200 Iriſh Women and Children Marching out of it, the D. ſtood to obſerve them, and Teague O Regan appeared Mounted upon an Old Stone Horſe, very lame with Spavin and Scratches, and ſo vitious, that he would fall a Squeeling and kicking if any Body came near him; Teague himſelf had a great bunch upon his back, a plain red Coat, an Old Weather-beaten Wig hanging down at full length, a little narrow white Beaver Cockt up, a yellow Gravat-ſtring tyed all on one ſide, his Boots with a 1000 wrinkles, and though it was very hot, a great Muff hanging about his back, and for uniformity, he was almoſt fudled with Brandy: In this Equipage he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Duke; but had not made his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57819:79"/>ere the Jade fell to work, ſo that the D. had ſcarce time to make a Civil return; The Duke ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led afterwards, and ſaid, <hi>Teagues Horſe was very Mad, and himſelf very Drunk;</hi> The Officers and Soldiers made the Duke a great many Legs, and ſtared upon him, to ſee whether he was a Man or ſome other ſtrange Creature; for the Iriſh uſually asked one another, what <hi>is that Shambear that all this talk is of?</hi> The Duke inquired why they kept ſo many Women and Children in their Garriſon, which muſt needs conſume their Proviſions, <q>He was told, that the Iriſh are naturally very Hoſpitable, and that they all fared alike; but that the Soldiers would never be perſwaded to ſtay in Garriſon, without their Wives and Miſtreſſes:</q> The Duke replyed, <hi>There was more Love than Policy in it;</hi> The Iriſh were to be guarded to Armagh, and among them were 2 Prieſts, one of whom in the way, fell into diſcourſe with a Dragoon about Tranſubſtantiation; but being baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, was ſo angry, that he fell a beating the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon, who not being uſed to blows, thraſht the Prieſt ſeverely, of which complaint being made to Teague, he replyed; <hi>I be very glad of it, What te Deal had he to do to Diſpute.

            <p>King William being concerned that the War in Ireland ſhould divert his Forces from going into France, reſolved if poſſible, to reduce the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom this Summer, by going thither in Perſon, and every one knew his Majeſties Induſtry, Courage and Reſolution to be ſo great, that he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make a quick diſpatch, and accordingly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left Kenſington June 4. Ten days after he Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſafe at Carickfergus, with his Highneſs Prince George, the D. of Ormond, the Earls of Oxford, Mancheſter, Scarborough, and ſeveral other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, and was received by the Officers, Soldiers, and People with all manner of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57819:79"/>of Joy, the latter looking on His Majeſty as their good Angel, who was come to deliver them from worſe than Aegyptian Bondage; Next day ſeveral of the Nobility, Officers, Gentry, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, preſented a very Loyal Addreſs to the King, which he graciouſly accepted: His Majeſty was not idle, and ſeeing things did not go on ſo faſt as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, expreſt ſome Diſſatisfaction, ſaying, <hi>That he did not come there to let graſs grow under his Feet,</hi> he made his word good; for having taken a View of his Army, which with the great Recruits lately ſent from England, amounted to about 36000 Compounded of Engliſh, Dutch, Danes, Germans and French, His Majeſty advanced toward Dundalk.</p>
            <p>The certain News of K.W. Landing coming to Dublin, it was moved by ſome Iriſh in K. James's Council, That the Proteſtants ſhould be ſhut up in Churches and Hoſpitals, and then if they loſt the day, to ſet fire to all, and deſtroy the People and City together: But the Iriſh Papiſts both in the City and Army, applyed themſelves to the King, and told him; <q>They ſhould then be as much ſufferers as the Proteſtants, and that they would not draw a Sword in his Defence, unleſs all thoughts of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City were laid aſide; and declared further, that as ſoon as they heard of any appearance of Fire, they would Deſert his Service, and fly to K. Williams Mercy, which manaces put a ſtop to this Horrid Project.</q> Before this, a Camp had been laid out by the Iriſh about Ardee, and K. James had ordered his Army to Rendevouze there from ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, and June 16. he Marched out of Dublin to joyn them with about 6000 French Foot, moſt old Soldiers, well Armed and Clad. The whole Iriſh Army incamped, made about 27000, all well Clothed, and in good Heart, both Horſe and Foot, beſides 15000 more that remained in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57819:80"/>Garriſons, and the ſame day 6000 of the Country Militia cameto quarter in the City; The Proteſtants expected the Iriſh would have been much dejected upon K. Will Arrival; but on the contrary, they Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpht and Rejoyced as if they had got him in a Pound, and the day were their own, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, That either the French Fleet would prevent his return to England, or that an Inſurrection would be made there, boaſting that an Hundred Thouſand. Men were ready to Riſe and declare for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; The Proteſtants knew not what to believe, for they were kept as Priſoners of War, and could know no more than they pleaſe to tell them; but they were more afraid that ſome deſperate Perſons had undertaken to deſtroy K. William, becauſe their confidence was ſo great, that ſome told their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Friends, <hi>They would be glad to go to Maſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Twelvemonth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When K. James was gone, Collonel Lutterel, who was left Governor, Ordered all Perſons that walkt in the Streets without Swords or Bagonets, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and ſecured, whereby all Proteſtants who were ſuffered to wear none, were put into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; After which followed a Proclamation; That <q>not above 5 Proteſtants beſides the Family, ſhould meet together in any place upon pain of Death.</q> So that now they durſt not go to Church, as they had hitherto done, the Churchmen ſtill remained with them, though they had loſt all their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Iriſh Parliament, except what was given them by the People; Dr. King was ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the Caſtle, and few Proteſtants durſt walk the Streets: the method that K. James and the French propoſed to deal with K. Williams Army, was, To make good the Paſſes upon the Newry Mountains, and at Dundalk; To ſpin out the War, and diſpute their ground without coming to a General Battel,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57819:80"/>till they came to the Boyn, and there to Defend the Paſs; but ſtill without a Battle, if they could help it much hoping for ſome Extraordinary thing from a Party in England, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But K. William ſoon broke all their Meaſures, for reſolving to loſe no time, he came to the Camp at Lough-britland, where having taken a Critical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of every Regiment, His Majeſty and Prince George had their moving Houſes ſet up, and never after lay out of the Camp, during their-ſtay in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The King ordered a Party to go out to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the motions of the Enemy, and heard they were Marching off from Dundalk toward Ardee, Upon which the Engliſh Army advanced to Newry, and from thence to Dundalk, and ſo forward to Ardee, the Iriſh ſtill retiring, and at length paſſing over the Boyn: upon which the whole Army move in 3 Lines toward the Boyn, and by the way ſome Dragoons found in an Old Houſe about 200 Scythes ſtretcht out upon Beams, which the Enemy had either forgot, or left behind for haſt, and one of them being brought to the King, he ſmiled and ſaid, <hi>It was a Deſperate Weapon:</hi> The Iriſh Incamped on the other ſide the Boyn, and the King from an Hill took a view of them, and then rid along the River ſide to make more ſtrict Obſervations during which a Cannon Ball from the Enemy, kill'd 2 Horſes and a Man about 100 yards from the King; and inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes another, which had like to have been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bullet, for it grazed upon the Bank of the River, and in the riſing ſlanted upon the Kings right ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and tore out a piece of his Coat, and alſo the Skin and Fleſh; and afterward broke the Head of a Gentlemans Piſtol: A Gentleman ſeeing his Majeſty ſtruck, rid up, and put his Handkerchef upon the place: his Majeſty took little notice of it; but rid on about 40 yards further, the Enemies Cannon firing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57819:81"/>upon them all the while, and killed 2 of the Guards, and 9 Horſes, diſturbing the reſt; which the Iriſh perceiving, ſet up a prodigious ſhout all over the Camp, as if our Army had been deſtroyed; The King went to change his Coat, and get his Shoulder dreſt, and then rid about to ſee the Army; After which a Council of War was called; and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty declared, That he was reſolved to paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver next day, and accordingly all things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, every Man having a green Bough or Sprig in his Hat, the Enemy wearing pieces of Paper in theirs, the word that Night was Weſtminſter; and about 12 at Night, rid with Torches quite through the Army: The next Morning, July 1. the Dutch Blew Guards took the River firſt, ſome 8 or 10 a breaſt, being preſently almoſt up to the middle, the Enemy ſtood on the other ſide; but did not fire till our Men were toward the middle of the River, and then a whole Peal of ſhot came from the Hedges, Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works Houſes and all about; but only one Man fell, and another ſtaggered, a Lieutenant of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers was the firſt that got footing on the other ſide, who inſtantly drew up 2 Files of Men, then ſtoopt, and the Enemy fired over him from the next Hedge, and afterward quitted the Hedge, which, the reſt that were poſted thereabout, ſeeing, they likewiſe fled, and were followed by a volley of ſhot from our Men: When on a ſuddain, a great many Battaſions of the Enemy appeared from behind the little Hills; we had two French Regiments, and one Engliſh, who paſſed the River at the ſame time, about 200 yards below, and routed thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them; The Dutch Advanced ſtill, and the Iriſh quitted the Hedges and Van, ſtragling up and down the Field; All our Horſe went over to the Right and Left, except one Squadron of Danes, whom Lieut. Coll. Hamilton charged ſo home with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57819:81"/>60 Horſe, that they came faſter back, than they went; The want of Horſe was ſo apparent here, that the very Country People cryed out Horſe, Horſe, which word going to the Right Wing, who thought it had been Halt, ſtopt them nigh half an hours time; which with about 40 Iriſh Horſe breaking through the French Regiment at the ſame time, was thought to be the occaſion of D. Schombergs going over ſo unſeaſonably; for in this Hurry, he was killed near a little Village beyond the River; The Iriſh Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as they rid through, ſtruck at him with their Swords, and ſome believe that his own Men firing too haſtily when the Duke was before them, ſhot him themſelves; his Mortal Wound was through the Neck, and he had one or two Cuts in the Head, he fell down, and did not ſpeak a word; Dr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker going, as was ſaid, to look after the Duke, was ſhot in the Belly: The Action continued very hot for about an Hour; but then the Iriſh Retreated to a riſing ground, drew up to Charge our Party again that had paſſed the River; The Daniſh and Dutch Horſe with Collonel Woolſelys Horſe and Dragoons, and likewiſe the Daniſh Foot, and Collonel Cuts Regiment now got over the River; The King du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe Tranſactions, was almoſt every where, riding between our Army and theirs, and giving the neceſſary Orders, attended only with one Dragoon, and then paſſed the River with ſome difficulty; for his Horſe being Bog'd on the other ſide, he was forc'd to alight, till a Gentleman helpt him to get his Horſe out; when the Men were got on the other bank, and put in order, his Majeſty drew his Sword; but with ſome Trouble, by reaſon of his wounded Arm, and Marched before them toward the Enemy, who were coming in good Order upon our Foot, with double the number, and charged ſeveral times at the Head of them; Our Horſe were forced to give
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57819:82"/>ground, though the King was with them; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty then went to the Inniskilliners, and askt <hi>what they would do for him,</hi> and advanced before them; Their Officer told them who it was and at the Head of theſe Men, the King received the Enemies fire; The Daniſh Horſe once gave way; but the K. went himſelf, and brought them up again; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57819:82"/>it was obſerved, that moſt of the Horſemen who charged ſo deſperately, were drunk with Brandy, of which each Man that Morning, had half a pint for his own ſhare. Of the Engliſh, were killed nigh 400; but the greateſt loſs was of D.

            <p>K. James during part of the Action, ſtood at <hi>a little Old Church upon an Hill;</hi> but when he ſaw how matters went, he Marcht to Duleek, and from thence to Dublin; The firſt News at that place was, <q>That K. James had got the Day, Our General was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the P. of Orange (as they called him) taken Priſoner, that the French Fleet was in the Bay of Dublin; That a French Expreſs was come from Waterford, with the News of taking the Iſle of Wight by the French, and of their being gone to Dover:</q> This was very Afflicting to the poor Proteſtants, who were all confined to their Houſes; but towards night, ſome that had made their eſcape upon tyred Horſes, brought word, That the Iriſh were much worſted, and others That they were Totally routed; near 10 a Clock that Night, K. J. came in with about 200 Horſe all in Diſorder; they concluded now, that it was an abſolute Defeat, and that the Engliſh were juſt ready to come into the Town; but were greatly Surpriſed, when an hour or 2 after, they heard the whole Body of the Iriſh
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57819:83"/>Horſe coming in, in very good Order, with kettle Drums, Hautboys, and Trumpets; and early the next Morning, the French and a great part of the Iriſh Foot; who being a little reſted, Marched out again to meet the Engliſh that were ſuppoſed to draw nigh.</p>
            <p>When K. James came to the Caſtle Gate, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tyrconnel met him; and after he was up ſtairs, askt him what he would have for his Supper? Who then gave her an account, what a Breakfaſt he had got; which made him have but little Stomach to his Supper: Next Morning, July 2d. about 5 a Clock. K. J. ſent for the Iriſh Lord Mayor, and ſome Principal Perſons to the Caſtle, and told them; <q>That in England, he had an Army which durſt have fought; but they proved falſe, and Deſerted him; and that here he had an Army which was Loyal enough; but would not ſtand by him, ſo that he was now neceſſitated to provide for his Safety, and that they ſhould make the beſt Terms for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they could, he told his Menial Servants, That he ſhould now have no further occaſion to keep ſuch a Court as he had done; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were at liberty to diſpoſe of themſelves; He deſired them all to be kind to the Proteſtants, and not to burn or injure them nor the City, for though he quitted it, he did not quit his Intereſt in it; Immediately after he took Horſe, and with about twelve in Company went towards Bray, and ſo to Waterford,</q> having appointed his Carriages to meet him another way, where he imbarqued for France, having ſome days days before diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſſue, Ordered Sir Patrick Trant to go from the Camp at the Boyn to Waterford, and provide Shipping. It is ſaid, he did not ſleep till he got on Ship-board; All that day nothing was to be ſeen in Dublin, but Officers, Carriages, and duſty woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57819:83"/>Soldiers, with ſeveral of K. James's Horſe-guards coming in ſtragling, without Piſtols or Swords, and the Principal Popiſh Perſons of the Town, their Wives and Families going away; The Gates were ſtill kept by the Iriſh Militia, and the Caſtle by 250 of the Governors Foot Soldiers, who ſtill threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that before they left the City, they would burn and plunder it; This of a long time had been their talk (as we have heard) though K. James ſaid, <hi>It was a Report raiſed by the Proteſtants, to make him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> yet ſome Iriſh Perſons of Note adviſed their Proteſtant Friends a few days before this, to leave the Town, becauſe they would not be ſafe there.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants (ſome of whom were crouded into the Hoſpitals, Colledges and Churches, others into ſtinking, naſty, unhealthy Rooms) knew not yet what to think of themſelves; but hoped the Engliſh were ſo near as to prevent their being burnt; but about 4 afternoon inſtead of them, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Iriſh Horſe, which were drawn out in the Morning, and thought to be quite gone, entring the Town, followed by the French and Iriſh Foot in a full Body; Preſently a Noiſe run through the City, that they were come to fire it; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts who had ſecured themſelves in Proteſtants Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, began to look brisk again; but all theſe Forces Marched through the Town, without doing any injury, and were drawn up by Tyrconnel, on the further ſide of it, to March away; the Militia fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, only the Governor remained, who at laſt reſolved to March alſo, and drive 2 or 300 of the Principal Proteſtant Priſoners before him; but while they were preparing for this, a falſe Alarm was ſpread, that a Party of Engliſh being Landed at the Harbour, were juſt at the Towns end, it was too dusky to diſcover the Truth, and they had not time to ſend a Meſſenger; but in haſt ſhifted for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57819:84"/>themſelves. The Proteſtants now began to look out, (whom the Iriſh had releaſed, not out of love to them; but for fear the Engliſh were at their Heels) yet knew not well in what condition they were; but venturing to the Caſtle, they found Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Farlow, who had been Priſoner there; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garriſon alone, upon which, Captain Fitz Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald and ſeveral others who had been Priſoners, went and ſtaid there all Night; ſtill they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure, and had no Arms; Early next morning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 3. the Proteſtants run about to the Papiſts Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, demanding their Arms, who being quite diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, delivered them without diſpute; and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Meath, Dr King, and ſeveral other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Proteſtants ſent away an Expreſs to K.

            <p>The Night after the Battel, the Engliſh lay upon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57819:84"/>their Arms at Duleek, and next Morning a Party were ſent to fetch the Tents and Baggage from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Boyn, and another Party of 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, and 300 Foot, and 8 pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Marcht to Summon Droghedah; The Governor received the firſt Summons very indifferently; but being Threatned that if he forced the Cannon to be fired on them, they ſhould have no Quarter: Thereupon he believing that the Iriſh Army was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Routed, Surrendred upon Condition, to be Conducted to Athlone, there being about 1300 of them, who Marched out without Arms, according to Agreement.</p>
            <p>July 3. K. William Marcht forward, and was met at Bally Brigham, by one Mr. Saunders from the Proteſtants of Dublin, with a Tender of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance: The D. of Ormond Marched thither with 1000 Horſe, and the Dutch Guards took poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, and 2 days after his Majeſty came to Finglaſs, within 2 Miles of Dublin, 300 Citizens coming to wait upon, and welcom him and his Army, and abundance of People flockt from all places to ſee the Camp, and their Great Deliverer, whoſe juſt Merits found Commendations from his very Enemies; and whoſe Soul is not Subject to fear, or any thing that is below a Prince; and who is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faulty in expoſing his Royal Perſon too far. On Sunday, His Majeſty went to St. Patricks Church in Dublin, and returned to his Camp to Dinner, and on Munday, the Biſhops and Clergy Preſented a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Loyal Addreſs the Biſhop of Meath making a Speech, telling his Majeſty, <q>That they came not to beg his Protection, for he had given ſufficient Demonſtrations of his Affection toward them, by venturing his Royal Perſon for their Deliverance; but they came to Congratulate his Arrival, to pray for the Continuance of his good Succeſs, and to

            <p>The Iriſh went away in ſuch haſte, that they left 16000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in braſs Money in the Treaſury, and a great quantity of French Souſes; of the firſt of which, K. James coined above eleven Hundred Thouſand Pound; The half Crowns of which were now cryed down for pence: Yet this did not grate ſo heavily upon the People, as his late taking away all the Proteſtant Staple Goods, as Wool, Hydes, and Tallow, to ſend to France, in exchange for Wine and Linnen for his Army; Their Tanned Leather was alſo taken away, for the uſe of the Soldiers: The Revenue he raiſed otherwiſe, was by a Subſidy gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Parliament, of Twenty Seven Thouſand Pound a Month, for 13 Months; which fell ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Proteſtants, who were forced to pay ready Mony, though by Plundring they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deprived of their Stocks, Rents and Incomes; and to ſhew what future Security they were like to have for their Eſtates; K. James by Proclamation, under pretence of his Prerogative Royal, laid a Tax of 20000 <abbr>l.</abbr> a Month for 3 Months upon Goods and Chattels, that granted by Parliament, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Land; this way of Leavying Money, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

James ever receiv'd in Ireland.</p>
            <p>July 7. K. William publiſhed a Declaration, aſſuring all Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Soldiers, Farmers, Ploughmen and Courtiers; as alſo all Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Tradeſmen, Townſmen, and Artificers, of his Royal Protection, who ſhould return to their Abodes by Aug. 1. and deliver their Arms to the Juſtices of Peace, and that they ſhould be ſecured in their legal Rights, Goods, Stocks and Chattels &amp;c. The next day the King took a view of his Army by diſtinct Regiments, and though it rained very faſt, yet His Majeſty ſate on Horſeback in the midſt of it. It was obſervable, that with heat, duſt and marching, moſt of the Soldiers had got very ſore Lips, nor was His Majeſty himſelf exempt from this inconvenience, for he had toil'd and laboured as much as the beſt of them. July 9. The King had an account of the misfortune of the Engliſh and Dutch Fleets; and at the ſame time he divided his Army, going himſelf with the greateſt part Weſtward, and ſending Lieut. Gen. Douglas with 3 Regiments of Horſe, 2 of Dragoons, and 10 of Foot toward Athlone, about 50 miles from Dublin. In their march they took 2 Spies with Letters from Athlone; one was to adviſe one Tute to defend an Iſland nigh Mullingar, in which the Governor had ſtore of Horſes, and other things of value. Another Letter was from an Officer at Athlone to his Father in the Country; telling him, <q>That the Ld Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, D. of Berwick; and ſeveral other Great Officers were come to Lymerick with a good Body of Horſe, and that all their Army would be there in 2 or 3 days, ſo that they would make either a Hog or a Dog of it (as he expreſt it) That the Dauphin was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in England with a great Army; That the French had beat the Engliſh and Dutch Fleets; That D. Schomberg was dead, and it was ſaid the Prince of Orange was ſo too; That their King was gone to France, but it was no great matter where he was, for they were better without him.</q> Then he adviſed his Father not to take a Protection from the Engliſh, becauſe thoſe that did ſo, were lookt upon as Enemies: And after his Letter was ſealed,

            <p>July 9. His Majeſty encamp'd at Cromlin 2 miles Weſt of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, where he ſetled the method of granting Protections to thoſe Iriſh that would ſubmit to the Government; and gave Orders that upon pain of Death no Soldier ſhould dare Plunder the Country, or any protected Perſon, nor to take violently the leaſt value from either Proteſtant or Papiſt; abuſes of this kind having been lately complained of. Two days after, the King paſſing by the <hi>Neſs,</hi> ſaw a Soldier robbing a poor Woman, which inraged His Majeſty ſo much, that he beat him with his Cane, and Commanded that he, and others, found guilty of the like diſobedience, ſhould be Executed; which had ſo good effect upon that Army, that no Pilfering hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for a long time after.

July 22. Maj. Gen. Kirk ſent a Trumpet to Summon the Town of Waterford to ſurrender, which they refuſed in very civil Terms; but at length on the 25. they delivered it up on Articles, and at the ſame time the ſtrong Fort of Duncannon 7 miles below Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford was ſurrendred upon the like terms; The K. went into W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Majeſty held a Council, where he declared his reſolution to go for Engl. upon ſome accounts he had from thence, leaving Count Solms Commander in Chief; But a few days after having advice from England that the French were gone off the Coaſt, and had only burnt a ſmall Village in the Weſt, His Majeſty reſolved to return to the Army and Aug. 8. the L. Portland and Brigadier Stuart were ſent toward Lymerick with about 1100 Horſe &amp; Foot, and the next day the whole Army advanced; The K. having ordered their ſeveral Poſts ſent a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to Summon the Town: it ſeems a great part of the Ganiſon were for ſurrendring it, but Monſ.

            </p>
            <p>This City is very ſtrong, both by Nature and Art, and the Iriſh
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57819:87"/>had now added ſome new Fortifications to it. In 1651. Lieut. Gen. Ireton laid Siege to it for ſeveral Months, and did not take it at laſt, for it was in ſome meaſure betray'd to him, by one Col. Stennel, and others of the Iriſh who againſt the Governors conſent, received in a or 300 men, thereby getting Poſſeſſion of the Town; Ireton Hanged the Mayor, and ſeveral others that were ſtill for defending it.</p>
            <p>When His Majeſty ſate down before Lymerick, he had only a Field-Train of Artillery, becauſe ſome imagined the Town would have ſurrendred upon Summons: But it being refuſed, Six Cannon called Pounders, two 18 Pounders, a great quantity of Ammunition, Proviſions, tin Boats, and abundance of other materials, were upon the Road from Dublin, under the Convoy of 2 Troops of Col. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Horſe, of which Sarsfield having intelligence by a French Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who went over to the Enemy, he paſſed the River in the Night with a Body of Horſe; for being ſatisfied that if this Train arrived before Lymerick it would not be able to hold it, he reſolved to run the hazard of deſtroying them; If he ſucceeded, he broke our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; if not, he deſigned for France, as he afterward declared. The K. had notice of his march, and to prevent the worſt, ordered 500 Horſe to march and meet the Guns, but by ſome neglect in the Officers, it was 1 or 2 a Clock in the morning before the Party marched, which they then did very ſlowly, till about an hour after they ſaw a great light in the Air, and heard a ſtrange rumbling noiſe, which they imagined to be the blowing up of the Train, as really it was: For on Sunday night, Aug. 11. the Guns lay at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel, and on Monday they marched beyond Cullen to a little old ruinous Caſtle called Ballemedy, not 7 miles from the Camp, and being ſo near, did not fear an Enemy, eſpecially having no notice, and therefore being weary of marthing, had turn'd moſt of their Horſes to graſs, leaving a very ſlender Guard, and the greateſt part went to ſleep; but ſome never awaked in this World, for Sarsheld lurking among the Mountains all the day, &amp; being guided through by-ways to the very ſpot, he unawares fell in upon them, and cut ſeveral to pieces, with ſome Waggoners and Country People that were coming to the Camp with Proviſions. The Chief Officer ſeeing how it was, Commanded to Sound to Horſe, but thoſe that went to fetch them up, were killed by the way; The Officers and others after the beſt reſiſtance they could make, were forc't to ſhift for themſelves, with loſs of Horſes and Goods, a Lieutenant and ſome few Troopers were kill'd, in all about 60. The Iriſh got what Horſes they could, ſome broke the Boats, others the Guns, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Carriages and Waggons, with Bread and Ammunition together in an heap, what they could not carry away, they laid a Train and fired at their going off, blowing up all with an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe, whereby every thing that would burn was reduced to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57819:87"/>Aſhes. The Party of Horſe that were ſent againſt them came when the buſineſs was over, in ſight of the Enemies Reer, but wheeling toward the Left to intercept their paſſage over the Shannon, they unhappily went another way: This was very unwelcome News in the Camp; however the Siege went on, and ſeveral more Guns were planted, and Firings continued briskly from divers Batteries.</p>

Our Batteries plaid upon the Walls and Houſes of Lymerick, and the K. riding ſoftly up toward Cromwel's-Fort, as his Horſe was entring a Gap, a Gentleman ſtay'd His Majeſty to ſpeak with him, and in that very moment a great Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let was ſhot into that very place, which would have ſtruck His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Horſe too all in pieces, if his uſual good Angel had not defended him; yet it raiſed the duſt all about him, of which He took little notice, but alighting came and layed him down on the Fort among all the Duſt Aug. 20. A brisk Attack was made by Col. Cutt's Granadiers, who with ſome others made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a Fort near St. John's Gate; After which the Enemy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out of the Town, and a very hot Action happened, but the Iriſh was at length be at back into the Town with the loſs of 300 men; of ours 58 Foot were kill'd and 140 wounded; of Horſe 21 kill'd and 52 wounded. Aug. 23. A Truce was made for burying the Dead on both ſides. We found a French Officer wounded and his Horſe lying upon him, and yet he was alive and recovered, tho' he lay from Wedneſday to Saturday. A Chaplain in the Army happened to go down after the Fort was taken, and ſeeing a Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as he thought mortally wounded, he went to give him good Advice, which the other was very thankful for; In the mean time comes the Sally, and our Horſe came thundering down, at which the Clergy man haſtening away fell down; The wounded Trooper ſeeing him fall, thought he had been dead, and went to ſtrip him, having ſoon got off his Coat, at which the other called to him to hold, asking him what he meant; <q>Sir, ſays the Trooper, I beg your Pardon, for I believed you were kill'd, and therefore I thought my ſelf obliged to take care of your Cloaths, as well as you did of my Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Aug. 27. A Breach, about 12 yards long and pretty flat, being made nigh St. John's Gate, the K. gave order for attacking the Counterſcarp that Afternoon, which was done by 500 Granadiers, and ſome other Regiments of Foot and Horſe, with much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Iriſh having all their Guns ready, diſcharged great and ſmall ſhot among them abundantly, and our Men were not behind in either; ſo that in 2 Minutes the noiſe was ſo terrible, as if the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57819:88"/>Skies had rent aſunder, which was ſeconded with duſt, ſmoak and all the terrours that the Art of Man could invent to ruin and undo one another, the exceſſive heat making it yet more uneaſie. The Granadiers threw in their Granadoes, and afterward get upon the Counterſcarp: Upon which the Iriſh were throwing down their Arms, and running into the Town with all ſpeed; which our Men perceiving, entred the breach Pell mell upon them, and above half the E. of Drogheda's Granadiers, and ſome others were actually in the Town; the Regiments that were to ſecond the Granadiers went to the Counterſcarp, and having no Order to go further ſtopt; The Iriſh were all running from the Walls, and quite over the Bridge into the Engliſh Town, but ſeeing only a few of our Men enter, they were with much ado perſwaded to rally; Thoſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that were in, ſeeing themſelves not followed, and their Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition being ſpent, deſigned to retreat again, but ſome were ſhot, others taken, and very few came out again unwounded. The Iriſh then ventured on the Breach again, &amp; from the Walls and all other places ſeverely peſtered thoſe on the Counterſcarp for 3 hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Bullets, Stones, and broken Bottles, even from the very Women, who boldly ſtood in the breach, and were nearer our Men than their own; So that the Ammunition of the Beſiegers being ſpent, they thought it ſafeſt to return to their Trenches. In the heat of the Attack the Brandenburg Regiment, who behaved themſelves very well, were got upon the Black Battery, where the Enemies Powder happened to take fire, and blow up a great many of them the Men, Faggots, Stones, &amp;c. flying into the Air with a dreadful noiſe, From half an hour after 3 till 7 there was one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Fire of both great and ſmall ſhot without intermiſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the ſmeak from the Town reached in one continual Cloud to the top of a Mountain at leaſt 6 miles off; when our Men retreated, ſome were brought out of the Trenches dead, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Leg or Arm, and ſeveral Blind with Powder, and among them a great many Brandenburgers who lookt like Furies with the Gun-Powder. The King ſtood nigh Cromwel's Fort all the time, and afterward went to his Camp much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

We kill'd a great number of the Iriſh by our Cannon, but it cannot be thought their loſs ſhould be equal to ours, having the advantage of the Walls to defend themſelves.

The E. of Marlborough landed near Cork with ſeveral Forces, and was joyn'd by Major General Scravenmore and others, who preſently inveſted the Town, and ſoon after made a breach in the Walls; ſo that after ſeven days Siege the Garriſon ſurrendred upon Articles. Oct. 2. The Earl of Marlborough marcht thence to Kingſale; the Town was preſently delivered; he then ſent a Summons to the Governour to ſurrender up the Forts, who returned anſwer, <hi>That it would be time enough to talk of a Surrender a month hence;</hi> upon this ſeveral Batteries were raiſed againſt the old, and afterward the new Fort, which played with ſuch ſucceſs, that they were both delivered up. Oct. 15. following; After the taking theſe two Places, part of the Iriſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Kenny made ſeveral Incurſions, and burnt all the Towns and Villages of the Counties of Lymerick and Cork, and the Enemies gave leave to ſeveral Proteſtants to come from Lymerick, where all Proviſions were very ſcarce. In Novemb. General Ginkle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Dublin. In Decemb. ſeveral Rapperees were got to the end of the Bog of Allen about 12 miles from Dublin, it being about 40 miles in length, and having ſeveral woody Iſlands from whence they plundered all the adjacent Country; but Coll. Fouks drove them from their Poſts: Several ſmall Skirmiſhes happened in the Winter between the Engliſh and the Rapperees, wherein the firſt obtained divers notable advantages; though generally their Parties were much inferiour to the Enemy, which was a great diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them.</p>
            <p>May 7. 1691. The whole Army took the Field under General Ginkle, and the Iriſh were buſie in making preparations for their

Lewis's name, and required the Iriſh Officers to take new Commiſſions under the French King, in proſecution of the deſign of ſubjecting Ireland to France. The firſt place the Engliſh attempted was Ballymore, ſeated upon an high Tongue of him Land, jetting out into a Lake, and ſtrengthned with ſeveral Fortifications; five Batteries were raiſed againſt it and the next morning the General ſent a Meſſenger to the Governour, <q>That if the Garriſon would ſurrender within two hours, he would ſave their lives, and receive them as Priſoners of War; if not, that they ſhould expect no Quarter:</q> The Governour would not return a direct Anſwer, in hopes of better Terms; Whereupon ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>June 18. The Army marched from Bally more, and the next day came before Athlone, and thought it very ſtrange to ſee none but French Colours in four parts of an Iriſh Garriſon: A Battery of ten Guns was inſtantly planted, which were ſo well directed, that in a few hours the Baſtion againſt which they played was laid in Ruines, and the reupon General Ginkle ordered an Aſſault to be made: The Enemy ſeemed at firſt reſolved to have maintained the Breach, but upon fight of the Hand-granadoes they fled in great confuſion to the other ſide of the Town, which was divided by a River; ſo that the Engliſh had nothing to do but to enter, not 20 of our Men being wounded, and ſome few ſlain: One part of the Town being thus taken, the Cannon played with great ſucceſs upon the Caſtle and the Enemies Works on the other ſide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Triſh having b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57819:92"/>Commanders were received with a general joy and the higheſt marks of reſpect to their merits, who had been ſo ſerviceable to the Kingdom, Soon after the General imbarqued for England and was received very graciouſly by Their Majeſties, and created Earl of Athlone, the Parliament likewiſe ſending their thanks to him for his good ſervices deſiring him to communicate the ſame to all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that ſerved under him in this Expedition. And he together with them, was highly entertained with a noble Treat by the City of London.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Lords Juſtices were very diligent to ſettle matters in Ireland, which now began to breath again, after ſuch ruins and devaſtations as had been made by the brutiſh Iriſh And the Parliament in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land abrogated the Oath of Allegiance in that Kingdom and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Oath to be taken; Sir David Collier was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Auguſt</hi> 1692. <hi>The Ld, Vi. Sydney being conſtituted L. Leiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of Ireland arrived there, and was received with loud peals of Cannon and Complimented by the Nobility and after having taken the Oath the ſword was delivered to him, and the day ended with accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Joy and Boneſires. And ſoon after his Excellency iſſued out Writs for calling a Parliament in that Kingdom, who met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and his Excellency in an Eloquent Speech declared,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they enjoyed by being reſtored to this great Priviledge, ſince the Kingdom could not ſo well be recovered to any degree of ſettlement legally as by a Parlirment conſtituted and ſetled, and that behoped they would make uſe of at to paſs ſuch Laws as might tend to the firm ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telment of the Conuntrey upon the Proteſtant Intereſt, and that it would be a great ſatisfaction to his Majeſty to ſee them eſtabliſhed in peace and proſperity having had ſo great and glorious a part releiving them from the calamities under which they laboured.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this the Commons preſented their Speaker, and proceeded to ſwear their Members; They then ordered an Adreſs of Thanks to be drawn up to his Majeſty, and another to the Ld. Lieutenant, and then paſſed,</hi> 1. <hi>An Act of Recognition of Their Majeſties undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
